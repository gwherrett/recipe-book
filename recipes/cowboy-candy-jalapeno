# Cowboy Candy (Candied Jalapeños)

Sweet, sticky, and spicy jalapeño rings that you can spoon over burgers, tacos, sandwiches, or cheese boards. This is a small-batch, fridge-friendly version (no canner required), but the syrup is classic cowboy-candy style.

## Ingredients

### Jalapeños
- 450–500 g jalapeños (about 1 lb / 15–18 medium), sliced into 3–4 mm rings  
- 1 tsp kosher salt  

### Sweet brine
- 600 g granulated sugar (about 3 cups)  
- 240 ml apple cider vinegar (1 cup)  
- 60 ml water (¼ cup)  
- 1 tsp garlic powder  
- ½ tsp onion powder  
- 1 tsp smoked paprika (or sweet paprika)  
- ½ tsp turmeric (for colour)  
- ½–1 tsp crushed red pepper flakes (optional, for extra heat)

## Method

### 1. Prep the jalapeños
1. Wash jalapeños and trim the stems.  
2. Slice into even rings (3–4 mm). Keep the seeds for max heat; remove some if you want it milder.  
3. Toss the slices with 1 tsp salt in a bowl and let sit while you make the brine (this pulls a bit of moisture and wakes the flavour up).

### 2. Make the brine
1. In a medium saucepan, combine sugar, apple cider vinegar, water, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, turmeric, and pepper flakes (if using).  
2. Bring to a gentle boil over medium heat, stirring until the sugar is fully dissolved.  
3. Once boiling, reduce to a brisk simmer and cook 3–4 minutes to let the spices bloom.

### 3. Cook the jalapeños
1. Add the salted jalapeño rings (and any juices) to the hot brine.  
2. Simmer on low–medium heat for 5–8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the jalapeños soften, turn a deeper, slightly translucent green, and the syrup thickens slightly.  
   - Don’t cook them to mush—you want a bit of bite.

### 4. Jar them up
1. Using a slotted spoon, divide the jalapeño rings among clean, heatproof jars.  
2. Ladle the hot syrup over the jalapeños, making sure they’re fully submerged and leaving ~1 cm headspace at the top.  
3. Tap jars gently to release air bubbles; top up with syrup if needed.  
4. Wipe rims, add lids, and let cool to room temperature on the counter.

### 5. Chill & store
1. Once cool, refrigerate the jars.  
2. Let them sit at least 24 hours for the flavours to settle; 3–5 days is even better.  
3. Keeps in the fridge for about 1 month (always use a clean spoon).

## Variations

- **Honey twist:** Replace ½ cup of the sugar with liquid honey for a rounder sweetness.  
- **Smokier:** Add ½ tsp chipotle powder or use a few sliced red jalapeños for colour and depth.  
- **Milder batch:** Substitute part of the jalapeños with sliced banana peppers or poblanos.
