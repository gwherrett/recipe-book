## 🧂 Ingredients

- 1 cup Heinz ketchup  
- 1 tbsp curry powder (madras for extra heat)  
- 1 tsp smoked paprika  
- ½ tsp cayenne pepper (adjust to taste)  
- ½ tsp ground cumin  
- ½ tsp ground coriander  
- ½ tsp garlic powder  
- ½ tsp onion powder  
- 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar  
- 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce

## 🍳 Method

1. In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine Heinz ketchup, curry powder, smoked paprika, cayenne, cumin, coriander, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper.  
2. Stir in the apple cider vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, and brown sugar or honey.  
3. Let the mixture simmer gently for 5–7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the spices are bloomed and the flavors deepen.  
4. Add 1–2 tablespoons of water to thin it out to your preferred consistency, if needed.  
5. Taste and adjust seasoning—more cayenne or chili flakes will boost the heat.  
6. Let cool before transferring to a clean jar or squeeze bottle.
