## Ingredients
- 2 medium zucchinis, cut into 1/2–1 inch half-moons
- Kernels from 2 ears fresh corn (about 2 cups) or 2 cups frozen corn (no need to thaw)
- 3–4 celery stalks, sliced 1/2 inch thick (about 2 cups)
- 1 red bell pepper, seeded and chopped
- 1 yellow bell pepper, seeded and chopped
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 2–3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2–3 ripe tomatoes, chopped (or 1 can 14 oz diced tomatoes, drained)
- 3 tbsp olive oil
- 1 bay leaf
- 1/2 tsp dried thyme (or a few fresh sprigs)
- 1 tsp kosher salt, plus more to taste
- Freshly ground black pepper
- Optional: 2–3 sprigs fresh rosemary
- To finish: torn fresh basil or parsley, a drizzle of olive oil, and a splash of red wine vinegar or lemon juice

## Method
1. **Start the base.** Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion with a pinch of salt and cook 4–5 minutes until translucent. Stir in garlic; cook 30–60 seconds until fragrant.
2. **Build the vegetables.** Add bell peppers and celery; cook 5–6 minutes, stirring occasionally, until starting to soften.
3. **Add zucchini & corn.** Stir in zucchini and corn; cook 4–5 minutes to lightly sear.
4. **Simmer.** Add tomatoes, bay leaf, thyme, rosemary (if using), 1 tsp salt, and several grinds of pepper. Bring to a gentle simmer, cover, and cook 20–25 minutes, stirring occasionally.
5. **Reduce & balance.** Uncover and simmer 8–10 minutes more to thicken to a stew-like consistency. Remove bay leaf (and rosemary sprigs). Off heat, adjust salt/pepper and brighten with a small splash of red wine vinegar or lemon. Finish with a drizzle of olive oil and torn basil or parsley.

## Notes & Tips
- **Texture:** Aim for tender but distinct vegetables—avoid overcooking into a mush. If liquid runs high, simmer uncovered a bit longer.
- **Make-ahead:** Tastes even better the next day. Keeps 4 days refrigerated. Reheat gently; add a splash of water if needed.
- **Serve with:** Crusty bread, creamy polenta, couscous, or as a topping for grilled fish or chicken. Great with feta or chèvre.
- **No eggplant version:** This recipe intentionally omits eggplant and features corn + celery for sweetness and crunch.

## Variations
- **Spicy:** Add 1/2 tsp chili flakes with the garlic.
- **Smoky:** Stir in 1/2 tsp smoked paprika with the tomatoes.
- **Herby:** Swap thyme for herbes de Provence (1 tsp).
