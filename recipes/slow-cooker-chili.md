## Method

1. **Sauté the mirepoix:**  
   Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion, carrots, and celery with a pinch of salt. Cook 5–7 minutes until softened and lightly golden.  

2. **Brown the beef:**  
   Add the ground beef and cook until browned, about 8–10 minutes. Stir in the garlic for 30 seconds.  

3. **Bloom the tomato paste and spices:**  
   Stir in tomato paste and cook 2–3 minutes until darkened. Add all spices and cook another 30–60 seconds to toast.  

4. **Deglaze and transfer:**  
   Deglaze with ½ cup lamb broth, scraping up browned bits, and transfer to slow cooker.  

5. **Add remaining ingredients (except beans):**  
   Stir in the remaining lamb broth, tomatoes, vinegar, sweetener, soy sauce, bouillon, cocoa powder, and Worcestershire sauce. Mix well.  

6. **Cook:**  
   Cover and cook on **Low for 6–8 hours** or **High for 3–4 hours**.  
   Add the **beans during the final hour** so they heat through without softening too much.  

7. **Finish & Serve:**  
   Adjust seasoning with salt, vinegar, or hot sauce.  
   Serve with toppings such as shredded Cheddar, sour cream, scallions, or crushed tortilla chips.

## Notes
- Lamb broth adds a deep, savory flavor in place of beer.  
- Carrots and celery enhance sweetness and texture.  
- Cocoa, vinegar, and soy give balanced umami depth — adjust acidity to taste before serving.
