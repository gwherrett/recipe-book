# Smoked Side Ribs on the Barbecue

## Butchering the Ribs

1. **Remove the Membrane:**  
   Loosen the membrane on the bone side with a knife, grip with a paper towel, and peel it off.

2. **Trim Excess Fat:**  
   Remove loose meat or excess fat to prevent flare-ups and ensure even cooking.

3. **Square Off the Ribs (Optional):**  
   Trim the ends to uniform shape for even cooking.

4. **Remove Rib Tips (Optional):**  
   Slice off the rib tips below the main rib bones. Save for another use or cook alongside.

   Marinate overnight in apple cider vinegar, Worcestershire, and spices.

3. **Rest Before Cooking:**  
   Let ribs rest at room temperature for 30 minutes before grilling.

## Barbecue with Smoke Box

1. **Smoke Box Setup:**  
   - Soak wood chips (e.g. hickory, applewood) for 30+ minutes.  
   - Place in a smoke box or foil pouch with holes. Place over active burner or coals.

2. **Grill Setup (Indirect Heat):**  
   - Preheat to 225–250°F (110–120°C).  
   - Use one side of a gas grill or push coals to one side on charcoal.  
   - Add a water pan under the grill grates on the cool side.

3. **Cooking the Ribs:**  
   - Place ribs bone-side down on the cool side.  
   - Smoke for 4–6 hours, adding chips as needed.  
   - Look for meat pulling back from the bones and flexibility when bending.

4. **Foil Wrap (Optional):**  
   - After 2–3 hours, wrap in foil with apple juice or butter for added tenderness.

5. **Saucing (Optional):**  
   - In the last 30 minutes, brush with BBQ sauce and let it caramelize.

6. **Resting:**  
   - Let ribs rest for 10–15 minutes after removing from the grill before slicing.
