## Instructions

1. **Peel and devein shrimp:**
   Peel and devein shrimp; refrigerate shrimp and set shells aside. In Dutch oven, melt half of the butter over medium heat; fry shells, stirring, until shrimp shells turn bright orange, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add shrimp shells, stirring, until pink, about 2 minutes.

2. **Make stock:**
   Add sherry, bring to boil, scraping up any brown bits from bottom of pan. Add 6 cups (1.5 L) water and bay leaf; bring to boil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 30 minutes.

3. **Strain and cook rice:**
   Pour through fine sieve or cheesecloth-lined strainer into bowl, pressing to extract liquid. Return to Dutch oven. Whisk in rice, tomato paste, salt and cayenne pepper. Cover and simmer until rice is tender, about 20 minutes.

4. **Cook shrimp:**
   Meanwhile, in skillet, melt remaining butter over medium-high heat; sauté shrimp until pink and opaque, about 4 minutes.

5. **Blend and finish:**
   In blender, puree soup and shrimp, in 4 batches, until smooth. (Make-ahead: Let cool for 30 minutes; refrigerate, uncovered, in airtight container until cold. Cover and refrigerate for up to 2 days; reheat to proceed.) Return soup to clean Dutch oven. Whisk in cream and bring to bare simmer over low heat just until heated through but not boiling. Add lemon juice. Ladle bisque into warmed bowls; sprinkle with chives.

- Traditional French bisque technique using shells for stock
- Can be made ahead and refrigerated up to 2 days
- The rice acts as a thickener when pureed
- Don't let the soup boil after adding cream or it may curdle
- For richer flavor, use brandy instead of sherry
