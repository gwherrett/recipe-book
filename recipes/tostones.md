# Tostones (Fried Green Plantains)

**Source:** Serious Eats

Twice-fried green plantains that are crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. A beloved Caribbean side dish or snack, traditionally served with a dipping sauce.

**Yield:** 4 servings

## Ingredients

- 4 large green plantains (30 ounces; 850g)
- 2 cups (480ml) neutral cooking oil such as vegetable or canola oil
- Kosher salt, to taste
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder, or more to taste

---

## Directions

1. **Heat oil:**
   In a deep 10-inch cast iron or stainless steel skillet, add oil and heat oil over medium-high heat to 325ºF (160℃).

2. **Prepare plantains:**
   While the oil is preheating, peel the plantains by cutting off the ends and carefully cutting a slit down the sides of each plantain, cutting through the skin but not into the flesh. Remove the skin and then cut the fruit crosswise into 1-inch long chunks.

3. **First fry:**
   When oil reaches 325ºF (160℃), add half of the plantain chunks and fry until golden and fork tender, adjusting heat as needed to maintain oil temperature around 300 to 325ºF (150 to 160℃), 7 to 8 minutes, flipping over as needed to ensure even color. Use a slotted spoon to carefully remove the plantain chunks from the oil and transfer them to a cutting board.

4. **Smash plantains:**
   Using a tostonera (plantain press) or tortilla press, smash each plantain chunk until flattened and about ¼-inch thick. Repeat frying and smashing the remaining plantain chunks, setting the flattened ones aside to be fried again.

5. **Second fry:**
   Heat oil to 350ºF (175℃), add half of the flattened plantains back into the oil and fry for a second time until golden all over and starting to float, 2 to 3 minutes. Use a slotted spoon or spider skimmer to remove the tostones and transfer to a large mixing bowl. Return oil to 375ºF (175℃) and repeat frying process with remaining flattened plantains.

6. **Season and serve:**
   Once all are fried, immediately season with a large pinch of kosher salt and garlic powder, and toss to combine. Transfer tostones to a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet to drain any excess oil.

## Notes

- **Green plantains:** Must use green (unripe) plantains, not yellow or black ones
- **Smashing technique:** If you don't have a tostonera or tortilla press, you can use the bottom of a heavy plate or cutting board
- **Temperature control:** Maintaining proper oil temperature is key for crispy tostones
- **Serving suggestions:** Serve hot with garlic mojo, hot sauce, guacamole, or your favorite dipping sauce
- **Twice-fried method:** The first fry cooks the plantain through, the second fry creates the signature crispy exterior
- **Traditional Caribbean side dish:** Popular in Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Cuba, and throughout Latin America
