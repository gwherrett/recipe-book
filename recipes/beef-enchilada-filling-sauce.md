# Beef Enchilada Filling Sauce (Rich + Savory)

This sauce is designed to be the filling for rolled tortillas in enchiladas topped with both rojas and tomatillo sauces, along with cheese.

## Ingredients

- 1 lb ground beef  
- 1 small onion, finely diced  
- 2 cloves garlic, minced  
- 1 tsp ground cumin  
- 1 tsp chili powder (or ancho chili if available)  
- 1/2 tsp smoked paprika (optional)  
- 1/2 tsp dried oregano (preferably Mexican)  
- 1 tbsp tomato paste  
- 1/4 cup beef broth or water  
- Salt & pepper to taste  
- *Optional:* a splash of Worcestershire or soy sauce for umami  
- *Optional:* small handful of shredded cheese stirred in at the end (cheddar or Oaxaca)

## Instructions

1. Sauté the onions in a bit of oil over medium heat until soft.
2. Add garlic and cook for 30 seconds.
3. Add ground beef, breaking it up, and brown well.
4. Stir in cumin, chili powder, paprika, oregano, salt, and tomato paste. Cook for 1–2 minutes to toast the spices.
5. Add beef broth, stir, and simmer until saucy but not soupy.
6. Optional: Stir in a bit of shredded cheese to help bind the filling.

## Optional Additions

- **Diced roasted poblanos** or **chopped spinach** for depth.
- **Black beans** or **cooked rice** to stretch the filling and add texture.
- Replace part of the beef with **chorizo** for a spicier flavor.

This filling pairs well with rolled enchiladas topped with rojas and tomatillo sauce and baked with cheese.
