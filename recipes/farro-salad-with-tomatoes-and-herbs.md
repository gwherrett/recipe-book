## Directions

1. **Cook the farro:**
   Combine the water and farro in a medium saucepan. Add 2 teaspoons of salt. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the farro is tender, about 30 minutes. Drain well, and then transfer to a large bowl to cool.

2. **Add vegetables and herbs:**
   Add the tomatoes, onion, chives, and parsley to the farro, and toss to combine.

3. **Make vinaigrette:**
   In a medium bowl, whisk together the garlic, vinegar, salt, pepper, and olive oil. Add the vinaigrette to the salad and toss to coat.

4. **Serve:**
   The salad can be refrigerated overnight. Bring to room temperature before serving.

## Notes

- Farro is an ancient Italian grain with a nutty, chewy texture - similar to barley
- Can substitute pearled farro for faster cooking (20-25 minutes)
- Walla Walla onions are sweet and mild - can substitute Vidalia or any sweet onion
- Great for meal prep and picnics as it holds up well
- Can add crumbled feta or mozzarella for extra protein
- Fresh herbs are key to this dish - don't substitute dried
