  - Optional: 1/4 cup finely grated Parmesan or crumbled feta
  - Optional herbs: 1/4 cup chopped parsley or dill

- **Lemon‑Dijon Dressing**
  - 3 tbsp extra‑virgin olive oil
  - 2 tbsp fresh lemon juice (plus more to taste)

## Method
1. **Prep sprouts:** Halve any large sprouts through the core, then shave crosswise with a sharp knife or mandoline. Fluff with your fingers to separate layers.
2. **Mix dressing:** In a small jar or bowl, whisk olive oil, lemon juice, cider vinegar, Dijon, maple syrup, salt, and pepper until emulsified.
3. **Toss:** In a large bowl, combine shaved sprouts, apple, red onion, dried fruit, and half the nuts/seeds. Add dressing and toss for 30–60 seconds to slightly tenderize the sprouts.
4. **Finish & serve:** Fold in cheese (if using) and herbs. Top with remaining nuts/seeds. Taste and adjust with more lemon, salt, or pepper. Serve right away or chill 15 minutes to meld.

## Notes & Tips
- **Make‑ahead:** Shave sprouts up to 2 days ahead (refrigerate, covered with a paper towel). Dress up to 2 hours before serving; it stays crisp.
- **Add protein:** Shredded roast chicken, crispy chickpeas, or cooked quinoa make it a main.
- **Swap-ins:** Use pomegranate arils instead of dried fruit; swap lemon for orange for a sweeter profile; try toasted hazelnuts or pepitas.
- **Creamy variation:** Whisk 2 tbsp Greek yogurt or mayo into the dressing for a creamier slaw.
- **Serving ideas:** Great with roast meats, sandwiches, tacos, or as a base for grain bowls.

**Yield:** ~4–6 servings  
**Time:** 20 minutes (active)
