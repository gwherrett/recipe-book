# Osso Buco

**Source:** Umberto's Kitchen by Umberto Menghi (Douglas & McIntyre)

Traditional Italian braised veal shanks. These shanks are traditionally served with risotto, but mashed potatoes, polenta, rice or orzo work very well too. Don't omit the gremolata: the simple benediction of lemon peel, garlic and parsley makes this dish sing!

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the veal:**
   Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Season veal with salt and pepper to taste. Dip it in the flour, shaking off excess. Heat the oil in a large skillet. Over medium heat, sauté veal on all sides until brown to seal in juices. Transfer to a casserole dish just big enough to contain it.

2. **Make the sauce:**
   In a separate skillet, sauté onion in oil and butter over medium heat until transparent. Add the carrot, celery and garlic and sauté for 5 minutes. Add the wine, tomatoes with their liquid and the brown sugar and stir until well blended. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

3. **Braise:**
   Pour the sauce over the veal and place the casserole dish, covered, in the preheated oven for 1-1/2 hours. Uncover for the last 30 minutes.

4. **Make the gremolata:**
   Mix the lemon peel, garlic and parsley in a bowl.

5. **Serve:**
   Serve the veal on a warm serving platter or on warm plates, sprinkled with gremolata.
