# Long Bean, Cucumber & Tomato Salad  
*Thai Som Tum–Style Vegetable Salad*  
**Servings:** 4  
**Source:** January 2012

## Summary
A bright, crunchy Thai-style salad built on bruised long beans, cucumbers, and tomatoes, mixed directly into an aromatic dressing of chiles, garlic, lime, fish sauce, dried shrimp, and palm sugar. The key technique is pounding—or otherwise bruising—the vegetables so they absorb the dressing deeply.

## Ingredients
- 2 dried Thai chiles, soaked in warm water for 2 minutes, drained  
- 3 small garlic cloves, crushed  
- 1/4 lime, cut into 3 wedges  
- 1 Tbsp palm sugar or granulated sugar  
- 1 Tbsp dried tiny shrimp  
- 9 long beans (about 2.5 oz) or green beans, trimmed and cut into 2.5" lengths  
- 2 Kirby cucumbers or 1 English cucumber, chopped into 1" pieces  
- 2 Tbsp Thai fish sauce (nam pla)  
- 2 Tbsp fresh lime juice  
- 6 cherry tomatoes, halved  
- 2 Tbsp crushed roasted unsalted peanuts  

### Ingredient Notes
Many Thai ingredients are available at Asian grocery stores.  

### Special Equipment
A deep mortar and pestle (clay/wood recommended).

## Preparation

1. **Make the dressing:**  
   Place the Thai chiles, garlic, lime wedges, and sugar in a clay mortar. Pound with a wooden pestle until mashed into a fine paste (about 5 minutes).  
   Add the dried shrimp and continue pounding until fully broken down (about 2 minutes).  
   *Alternative:* pulse all aromatics in a mini processor until finely chopped.

2. **Bruise the vegetables:**  
   Add the long beans to the mortar and lightly crush to bruise.  
   Add the cucumber pieces, fish sauce, and lime juice; mix well.

3. **Add tomatoes:**  
   Add the tomatoes, lightly crush, and mix into the salad.  
   *Alternative:* Place beans and tomatoes in a zip-top bag, roll a rolling pin over them to bruise, then transfer to a bowl with cucumbers and dressing.

4. **Marinate & finish:**  
   Let the salad sit for 10 minutes.  
   Stir in the crushed peanuts just before serving.
