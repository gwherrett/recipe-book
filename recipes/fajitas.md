# Fajitas Recipe

## Ingredients

### For the Fajitas:
- 1 lb (450g) chicken breasts or skirt steak, thinly sliced
- 1 red bell pepper, sliced
- 1 yellow bell pepper, sliced
- 1 green bell pepper, sliced
- 1 large onion, sliced
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp chili powder
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp onion powder
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Juice of 1 lime
- Fresh cilantro, chopped (optional)

### For Serving:
- Flour or corn tortillas
- Sour cream
- Guacamole
- Salsa
- Shredded cheese
- Lime wedges

## Instructions

1. **Marinate the Meat:**  
   In a large bowl, combine the sliced chicken or steak with olive oil, cumin, chili powder, smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper, and lime juice. Toss everything together until the meat is evenly coated. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours for more flavor.

2. **Cook the Meat:**  
   Heat a large skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the marinated meat. Cook for about 5–7 minutes (if using chicken) or until cooked through. If using steak, cook to your desired doneness, about 4–6 minutes per side for medium-rare. Remove the meat from the pan and set aside.

3. **Cook the Vegetables:**  
   In the same pan, add a little more oil if needed, and toss in the sliced peppers and onions. Sauté them until they are tender and slightly charred, about 5–7 minutes.

4. **Combine and Serve:**  
   Once the vegetables are cooked, add the meat back into the pan. Toss everything together to combine and heat through.  
   Serve the fajitas hot with warm tortillas and your favorite toppings like sour cream, guacamole, salsa, shredded cheese, and lime wedges.

Enjoy your homemade fajitas!
