### **Ingredients**

**Wet ingredients:**
- 3 ripe bananas (medium, about 300 g), mashed until smooth  
- 1 whole egg  
- 2 egg whites  
- 1/3 cup plain Greek yogurt (low-fat)  
- 1/4 cup demerara sugar  
- 1 tsp vanilla extract  
- 2 tbsp neutral oil (canola, avocado, or olive oil — optional but improves fluffiness)

**Dry ingredients:**
- 3/4 cup rolled oats, ground into flour  
- 3/4 cup all-purpose flour (or white whole-wheat flour for extra fiber)  
- 2 tbsp milk powder  
- 1 tsp baking powder  
- 1/2 tsp baking soda  
- 1/4 tsp salt  
- 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon (optional)

**Optional add-ins:**
- 1/3 cup chopped walnuts or pecans  
- 2 tbsp oat flakes for topping

### **Method**

1. **Preheat the oven:**  
   Heat to **350°F (175°C)**. Grease or line a 9×5-inch loaf pan with parchment paper.

2. **Blend oats:**  
   Grind rolled oats in a blender or food processor until fine, like flour. Set aside.

3. **Whisk wet ingredients:**  
   In a large bowl, whisk together mashed bananas, yogurt, demerara sugar, egg, egg whites, vanilla, and oil until smooth and slightly frothy.

4. **Mix dry ingredients:**  
   In another bowl, whisk together oat flour, all-purpose flour, milk powder, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon.

5. **Combine gently:**  
   Add dry ingredients to the wet mixture and stir until *just combined*. The batter should be thick but pourable—don’t overmix or it will toughen.

6. **Add nuts (optional):**  
   Fold in walnuts or pecans if using.

7. **Bake:**  
   Pour into the prepared pan, smooth the top, and sprinkle with oats if desired.  
   Bake **45–50 minutes**, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean with a few moist crumbs.

8. **Cool:**  
   Cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer to a rack. Let it cool completely before slicing.

### **Tips for a Fluffier Texture**
- Don’t overmix after adding dry ingredients — that keeps air in the batter.  
- Room-temperature eggs and yogurt help with even rise.  
- The combo of baking soda + baking powder gives a balanced lift.  
- A little oil improves tenderness without compromising heart-healthy goals.

**Storage:**  
Keeps for up to 3 days at room temperature or 5 days refrigerated. Freezes well (slice before freezing for easy grab-and-go portions).
