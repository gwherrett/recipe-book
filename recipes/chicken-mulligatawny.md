## Ingredients

- 1 roasting chicken (about 3-4 lbs)
- Boiling water (enough to cover chicken)
- 1 large onion, sliced (divided)
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 pepper, minced
- 8 oz carrots, minced
- 2 oz celery, chopped
- 2 apples, diced
- 1 oz plain flour
- 1 tablespoon curry powder

## Method

1. **Make the stock:**
   Cut the chicken into pieces and put it into a heavy saucepan with boiling water and half the sliced onion. Simmer until chicken is cooked through, about 45-60 minutes.

2. **Brown the chicken:**
   Heat the butter in a frying pan and brown the chicken pieces. Remove chicken and set aside. Remove meat from bones and return bones to the stock. Continue boiling until liquid is reduced by about one-third.

3. **Make the curry base:**
   In the same pan, cook remaining onion, pepper, carrots, celery, and apples. Add flour and curry powder, stirring to form a smooth paste. Add sugar and cook until well combined.

4. **Combine and simmer:**
   Add the strained chicken stock to the vegetable mixture. Add mace, cloves, tomatoes, and tomato pulp. Bring to the boil and simmer until vegetables are tender.

5. **Finish the soup:**
   Strain or blend the soup to desired consistency (can be left chunky or pureed). Return the chicken meat to the saucepan and heat through.

6. **Serve:**
   Serve hot with boiled rice in a separate dish.
