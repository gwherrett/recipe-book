## Ingredients
- 4 salmon fillets (about 170 g / 6 oz each)  
- 4 tbsp unsalted butter  
- 2 anchovy fillets, finely chopped  
- 2 garlic cloves, finely minced  
- ½ tsp chili flakes (optional)  
- 2 tsp lemon juice (plus wedges for serving)  
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper  
- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)

## Method
1. **Prepare the butter:** In a small pan, melt butter over medium-low heat. Add anchovies, garlic, and chili flakes (if using). Stir until the anchovies melt into the butter, about 1–2 minutes. Add lemon juice and remove from heat.  
2. **Cook the salmon:** Pat fillets dry. Season both sides with salt and pepper.  
3. Heat a non-stick or cast-iron pan over medium-high heat with a little oil. Place salmon skin-side down and cook until crisp, 4–5 minutes. Flip and cook 2–3 minutes more, until just opaque.  
4. **Finish:** Spoon the warm anchovy-garlic butter over the salmon. Garnish with parsley and serve with lemon wedges.

**Notes:**  
- Anchovy butter can be made ahead and kept refrigerated for up to a week.  
- Substitute steelhead trout or Arctic char if preferred.
