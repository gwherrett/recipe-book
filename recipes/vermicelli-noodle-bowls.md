# Vermicelli Noodle Bowls

A fresh, vibrant Vietnamese-style noodle bowl with rice vermicelli, crisp vegetables, fragrant herbs, and a tangy nuoc cham dipping sauce.

## Ingredients

### Noodles
- 8 oz rice vermicelli noodles

### Toppings
- 2 cups shredded lettuce or spring mix
- 1 cup bean sprouts
- 1 cucumber, julienned
- 2 carrots, julienned or grated
- Fresh mint leaves
- Fresh cilantro
- Fresh Thai basil leaves
- ¼ cup roasted peanuts, roughly chopped
- Lime wedges

### Protein (choose one)
- 1 lb shrimp, peeled and deveined
- OR 1 lb chicken breast, thinly sliced

### Nuoc Cham (Dipping Sauce)
- 3 tablespoons fish sauce
- 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- ¼ cup warm water
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1–2 Thai chili peppers, thinly sliced (adjust to taste)

## Instructions

1. **Make the nuoc cham.**
   Combine the fish sauce, lime juice, sugar, and warm water. Stir until the sugar fully dissolves. Add garlic and chili. Taste and adjust — it should be balanced between salty, sour, sweet, and spicy. Set aside.

2. **Cook the noodles.**
   Cook the rice vermicelli according to package instructions (typically soak in boiling water 3–5 minutes, or boil briefly). Drain and rinse well under cold water to stop cooking and prevent sticking.

3. **Cook the protein.**
   Season shrimp or chicken with salt and pepper. Heat a thin layer of oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook shrimp 1–2 minutes per side until pink and opaque, or cook chicken slices until cooked through (3–4 minutes). Remove from heat.

4. **Assemble the bowls.**
   Divide noodles among 4 bowls. Arrange lettuce, bean sprouts, cucumber, and carrots on top. Add the cooked protein.

5. **Garnish and serve.**
   Top with fresh mint, cilantro, and basil. Scatter peanuts over the top and add lime wedges. Spoon nuoc cham over the bowl or serve on the side for dipping.

## Notes

- Vermicelli cooks fast — keep an eye on it to avoid mushiness.
- Nuoc cham keeps well in the fridge for up to 1 week.
- For a vegetarian version, use crispy tofu and replace fish sauce with soy sauce or vegan fish sauce.
- Pickled daikon and carrots (do chua) make an excellent addition as a tangy topping.
