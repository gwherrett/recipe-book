# Duck Oyakodon (Japanese Duck & Egg Rice Bowl)

**Category:** Rice Bowls / Japanese  
**Tags:** duck, rice bowl, oyakodon, Japanese, leftovers

### Summary
A comforting donburi-style dish adapting classic oyakodon with leftover cooked duck instead of chicken. The duck is warmed in a light dashi-sake-soy broth with onions, then topped with gently set eggs and served over rice. The richness of duck pairs beautifully with the delicate broth and silky eggs.

### Ingredients
- 2 cups (≈ 475 ml) hot cooked white rice  
- 240 ml (1 cup) dashi (homemade or instant)  
- 2 Tbsp (30 ml) sake  
- 1 Tbsp (15 ml) soy sauce (adjust to taste; duck is rich so you may want a little less)  
- 1 Tbsp (12 g) sugar  
- 1 large onion, thinly sliced  
- 12 oz (≈ 340 g) cooked duck meat (from broth, shredded or chopped bite-size)  
- 3 large eggs, lightly beaten  
- 2–3 scallions, thinly sliced  
- Small handful mitsuba (or substitute parsley, celery leaves, or cilantro) – optional  
- Togarashi (Japanese chili powder), optional for garnish

### Method
1. **Prepare the base**  
   Combine dashi, sake, soy sauce, and sugar in a wide skillet or shallow pan. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.

2. **Cook the onion**  
   Add sliced onion and simmer until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.

3. **Warm the duck**  
   Add cooked duck pieces to the broth and onion mixture. Warm gently for 2–3 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.

4. **Add scallions and mitsuba**  
   Stir in half the scallions and mitsuba (if using), reserving the rest for garnish.

5. **Set the eggs**  
   Lower heat to a gentle simmer. Drizzle the beaten eggs over the mixture in a thin stream. Cover and cook until eggs are just set:
   - 1–1.5 minutes for soft and runny  
   - 2–3 minutes for firmer but custardy  

6. **Assemble bowls**  
   Spoon hot rice into bowls. Slide the duck-egg mixture (with some broth) over the rice.

7. **Garnish and serve**  
   Top with remaining scallions and togarashi. Serve immediately.

### Notes
- Avoid overcooking the duck; it only needs to be reheated.  
- Add a splash more dashi or sake if the broth becomes too rich.  
- For a traditional touch, serve slightly runny so the egg melds with the rice.  
- Mitsuba or parsley adds a clean herbal contrast to the duck’s richness.
