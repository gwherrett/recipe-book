# Minestrone

This glorious vegetable and bean soup can be adapted to use any vegetables you have lying around, more or less — but Nigella prefers not to include tomatoes here. The only drawback is that the soup, after all the cooking, turns out an undeniable khaki. But it tastes so good, with an almost honeyed savouriness, that it really doesn't matter.

Should you want to make this vegan, simply use more oil in place of the butter, omit the Parmesan, and shake over some flakes of nutritional yeast at the end, if wished.

## Ingredients (Serves 4-6)

- 6 tablespoons olive oil
- 40g butter
- 3 onions, peeled and finely sliced
- 5 carrots, peeled and diced
- 2 stalks celery, chopped fairly small
- 300g potatoes, peeled and diced
- 3 courgettes, diced
- 100g fine green beans, cut into 1cm lengths
- 225g savoy cabbage, shredded
- 1.5 litres stock (beef, chicken or vegetable as you wish)
- Rind of finished piece of Parmesan cheese (optional)
- 400g can of cannellini beans, drained
- 150g ditalini or chifferi rigati (or other soup pasta)
- 40g freshly grated Parmesan, plus more to serve

## Instructions

1. **Soften the onions**
   Get a big pot and put in the oil and butter and sliced onion and cook until the onion is softened but not browned.

2. **Add the vegetables**
   Add the chopped carrot, cooking for about 3 minutes, and then add the celery, potatoes, courgettes and green beans, cooking each one for a few minutes, stirring a few times. Then add the shredded cabbage and cook for about 6-8 minutes, stirring now and then.

3. **Simmer**
   Add the stock, and rind of cheese if you are using it, give a good stir and taste for seasoning. Cover the pan and cook at a gentle simmer for 2 hours, until the soup has reduced slightly but still has enough liquid in it for the pasta to absorb while it's cooking. Add some water before you add the pasta if you need to.

4. **Add beans and pasta**
   Remove the lid and add the cannellini beans and cook for 5 minutes, then turn up the heat slightly and add the pasta, cooking according to the packet instructions.

5. **Finish and serve**
   When the pasta is ready, take out the Parmesan rind, add the fresh Parmesan and give the pan a good stir. Serve with more cheese.
