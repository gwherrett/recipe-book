## 🌮 Kale-Cabbage-Carrot Taco Slaw
A bright, crunchy, and simple slaw perfect for tacos — a lighter and fresher alternative to plain cabbage.

### Ingredients
- 1 cup finely shredded green cabbage  
- 1 cup finely chopped kale (stems removed)  
- 1 medium carrot, grated  
- 1½ tbsp fresh lime juice  
- 1 tbsp olive oil (or neutral oil)  
- ½ tsp salt (or to taste)  
- ¼ tsp ground cumin *(optional)*  
- Pinch of chili flakes or dash of hot sauce *(optional)*  

### Method
1. In a medium bowl, combine cabbage, kale, and carrot.  
2. Drizzle with lime juice and olive oil.  
3. Add salt, cumin, and optional chili flakes.  
4. Toss until evenly coated.  
5. Let sit 5–10 minutes to soften the kale slightly before serving.  

### Notes
- Keeps up to 2 days refrigerated.  
- For a creamier version, mix in 1 tbsp sour cream or mayo.  
- Excellent with fish, shrimp, or chicken tacos.
