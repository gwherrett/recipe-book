### Method

1. **Brown the Turkey**  
   Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high. Brown turkey in batches until no longer pink. Season with salt and pepper.

2. **Sauté Aromatics**  
   In the same pan, sauté onions, celery, and peppers for 5–7 minutes. Add garlic and tomato paste; cook 1 minute to caramelize.

3. **Combine in Slow Cooker**  
   Transfer all ingredients to a 6–8 qt slow cooker: browned turkey, aromatics, crushed tomatoes, broth, guajillo paste, beans (if using), spices, vinegar/lime, and cocoa/harissa (if using). Stir thoroughly.

4. **Cook Low & Slow**  
   - Low: 7–8 hours  
   - High: 4–5 hours  
   Stir once during cooking if convenient.

5. **Finish**  
   Taste and adjust salt, spice, and acidity. If too loose, cook uncovered on High for 20–30 minutes to thicken.

6. **Serve**  
   Garnish with cilantro, diced onion, or a dollop of yogurt or sour cream. Serve with rice, cornbread, or flatbread.

### ✨ Notes
- Guajillo adds earthy, dried-fruit depth and mild heat.  
- Optional cocoa or harissa gives smoky sweetness and richness.  
- Freezes beautifully; reheat gently with a splash of broth or water.
