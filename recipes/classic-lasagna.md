# Classic Lasagna with Bolognese, Ricotta, and Parmesan

## Ingredients
- 12 lasagna noodles
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 pound ground beef
- 1 pound ground pork
- 1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes
- 1 (6-ounce) can tomato paste
- 1 cup water
- 2 teaspoons sugar
- 1 tablespoon dried basil
- 1 tablespoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1 (15-ounce) container ricotta cheese
- 2 eggs
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 4 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
- 2 cups grated Parmesan cheese

## Instructions
1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. Cook the lasagna noodles in a large pot of boiling salted water until al dente, about 8-10 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water.
3. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add onion and garlic; cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.
4. Add ground beef and pork. Cook until browned, breaking up any clumps. Drain excess grease.
5. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, water, sugar, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil, then simmer 25-30 minutes.
6. In a bowl, mix ricotta cheese, eggs, parsley, salt, and pepper.
7. To assemble: spread 1 cup of bolognese on the bottom of a 9x13-inch dish. Add 4 noodles, 1/3 ricotta mix, 1/3 mozzarella, 1/3 Parmesan, and 1/3 sauce. Repeat layers twice more.
8. Finish with mozzarella and Parmesan on top.
9. Cover with foil (avoid touching cheese) and bake 25 minutes. Remove foil; bake another 25 minutes until bubbly and golden.
10. Let rest 15 minutes before slicing.

Serve with garlic bread and a green salad. Enjoy!
