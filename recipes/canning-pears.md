## Method

### 1. Select & Prepare Pears
Choose sweet, ripe pears (they ripen after picking). Wash, peel, halve or quarter, and core. Remove blemishes. Keep prepared fruit in lemon-water or sprinkle with Fruit-Fresh to prevent browning.

### 2. Make Syrup
Combine sugar and water (or juice) for desired sweetness. Heat to dissolve sugar; bring to a gentle boil and keep hot.

### 3. Sterilize Jars & Lids
Wash jars and lids. Sterilize jars 10 minutes in boiling water (or dishwasher sanitize cycle). Heat lids 5 minutes in hot water.

### 4. Hot Pack (Recommended)
Add cut pears to boiling syrup; simmer 5 minutes. This helps them pack better and reduces floating.

### 5. Pack Jars
Fill hot jars with pears and cover with hot syrup, leaving ½-inch headspace. Remove air bubbles by running a knife or spatula along the inside. Wipe rims clean and secure lids fingertip-tight.

### 6. Process
Place jars in boiling-water canner with 1 inch of water above lids.

**Processing times (hot-pack):**

| Jar Size | 0–1,000 ft | 1,001–3,000 ft | 3,001–6,000 ft | 6,001+ ft |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|----------------|-----------|
| Pints     | 20 min      | 25 min         | 30 min         | 35 min    |
| Quarts    | 25 min      | 30 min         | 35 min         | 40 min    |

### 7. Cool & Store
Remove jars carefully; cool undisturbed overnight. Check seals (lid center should not flex). Store in a cool, dark, dry place up to 12–18 months.

## Notes

- Floating fruit = syrup too heavy or loose packing.  
- Pink/blue tint after canning is harmless.  
- Safe to can unpeeled pears if desired.
