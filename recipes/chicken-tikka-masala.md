**Prep Time:** 20 minutes
**Cook Time:** 20 minutes
**Marinating Time:** 4 hours
**Total Time:** 4 hours 40 minutes
**Servings:** 6

## Equipment Needed:
- Metal Skewers
- Grill rack or Air Fryer
- Immersion blender or deep bowl for blending

## Ingredients:

### For the Marinade:
- **1½ lbs chicken breasts or thighs** (cut into 2-inch pieces)
- **¼ cup plain full-fat yogurt**
- **1 tablespoon lemon juice**
- **2 teaspoon ginger paste**
- **2 teaspoon garlic paste**
- **1½ teaspoon kosher salt**
- **¼ teaspoon ground turmeric**
- **2 teaspoon Kashmiri red chili powder**
- **1 teaspoon garam masala**
- **2 teaspoon dried fenugreek leaves** (kasoori methi)
- **1 tablespoon oil** (for basting)

### For the Curry Sauce:
- **2 tablespoon oil**
- **2 medium yellow onions** (diced, about 2 cups)
- **1 teaspoon ginger paste**
- **1 teaspoon garlic paste**
- **3 plum tomatoes** (chopped, or 1½ cups tomato puree)
- **¼ teaspoon ground turmeric**
- **2 teaspoon kosher salt**
- **1 to 2 teaspoon Kashmiri red chili powder** (adjust to taste)
- **1 teaspoon garam masala**
- **¾ cup water**
- **½ cup heavy cream** (or ½ cup cashews blended with ½ cup water)

### Optional for Smoky Flavor:
- **1 piece charcoal**
- **¼ teaspoon ghee**

### To Garnish:
- **1 tablespoon dried fenugreek leaves** (kasoori methi)
- **½ cup chopped cilantro**

## Instructions:

### Marinate and Cook the Chicken:
1. **Marinate the Chicken:**
   In a mixing bowl, combine all marinade ingredients. Add chicken and coat well. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or overnight for best flavor.

2. **Cook the Chicken:**
   Thread the marinated chicken onto skewers or place on a grill rack. Bake in a preheated oven at 400°F for 15 minutes, then broil for 2-3 minutes to get charred edges. Alternatively, cook in the air fryer at 380°F for 10-15 minutes. Let the chicken rest for 5 minutes.

### Make the Sauce:
3. **Sauté the Onions:**
   In a large skillet or Dutch oven, heat oil over medium heat. Add onions and sauté for about 10 minutes, stirring every couple of minutes. Cover after each stir to retain moisture and avoid browning.

4. **Add Aromatics and Spices:**
   Add ginger and garlic paste, sauté for 30 seconds. Stir in tomatoes (or puree), turmeric, salt, chili powder, and garam masala. Add the water, cover, and cook for 15 minutes.

5. **Blend the Sauce:**
   Blend the mixture into a smooth sauce using an immersion blender or in a deep bowl.

### Combine Chicken and Sauce:
6. **Finish the Curry:**
   Return the sauce to the pan. Add cooked chicken, cream (or cashew blend), and fenugreek leaves. Mix well and simmer until everything is heated through.

### Add Optional Smoky Flavor (Dhungar):
7. **Create the Smoke:**
   For a tandoori-style aroma, place a small steel bowl over the curry. Using tongs, heat a charcoal piece over an open flame until red-hot. Place the charcoal in the bowl, drizzle ghee on top, and immediately cover the pan to trap the smoke. Let it infuse for 5 minutes, then discard the charcoal and stir the curry.

### Garnish and Serve:
8. **Final Touch:**
   Sprinkle with chopped cilantro and serve hot with **naan**, **paratha**, or steamed **basmati rice**.

## Serving Suggestion:
Serve hot with naan, paratha, or steamed basmati rice for an authentic Indian dining experience.
