# Greek Yogurt Tartar Sauce (Healthy)

**Category:** Condiments & Sauces  
**Tags:** lighter, high-protein, no-mayo, pescatarian

A creamy, tangy tartar sauce made with plain Greek yogurt instead of mayonnaise—lower in calories and higher in protein, with all the classic flavor.

## Ingredients
- 1 cup plain Greek yogurt (2% or 5% for best texture)
- 2 tbsp dill pickles, very finely chopped (or cornichons)
- 1 tbsp capers, drained and chopped *(optional but great)*
- 1 tbsp fresh lemon juice (plus more to taste)
- 1 tsp Dijon mustard
- 1 tbsp fresh dill, finely chopped *(or 1 tsp dried dill)*
- 1–2 tsp finely grated shallot **or** 1/2 tsp onion powder
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- Pinch of kosher salt, to taste

## Instructions
1. In a bowl, whisk the yogurt until smooth. Stir in pickles, capers, lemon juice, Dijon, dill, and shallot/onion powder.
2. Season with pepper and a pinch of salt. Adjust acidity with more lemon if desired.
3. Cover and refrigerate **at least 30 minutes** to let flavors meld.
4. Stir before serving with fish, seafood cakes, or roasted veggies.

## Notes & Swaps
- **Sweeter/tangier:** Add 1/2 tsp sweet relish *or* an extra squeeze of lemon.
- **Herb variations:** Parsley or chives work well if you’re out of dill.
- **Texture tip:** For a thicker dip, use full-fat Greek yogurt or strain 0% yogurt for 15–30 minutes.
- **Make it mayo‑style:** For a richer classic vibe, whisk in 1–2 tbsp mayonnaise.

## Yield & Storage
- **Yield:** ~1 1/4 cups (10–12 servings as a condiment)
- **Storage:** Airtight container, **3–5 days** in the refrigerator.
