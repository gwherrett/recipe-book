**Recipe courtesy of:** Bonnie Stern School of Cooking

Duck breasts are an excellent meal for Thanksgiving. Buy large, meaty moulard duck breasts. Sometimes the breasts are as large as one pound each, which would be plenty for two people. The pomegranate and barberry sauce adds a sweet-tart Middle Eastern flair to rich duck.

**Servings:** 4

## Ingredients

### For the Duck:
- 4 duck breasts, about 12 ounces each
- 1 tablespoon chopped ginger
- 1 teaspoon chopped garlic
- 1 tablespoon cracked peppercorns

## Method

1. **Prepare the duck:**
   Preheat oven to 450°F. Score duck skin in 1-inch intervals. Combine ginger, garlic, peppercorns and coriander seeds. Rub into duck breasts.

2. **Render the fat:**
   Place breasts skin side down in a cold pan. Turn heat to medium and cook 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low and cook about 15 minutes or until fat is rendered. Drain fat as it accumulates in pan.

3. **Roast the duck:**
   Transfer breasts to a rack over a baking pan and bake for 7 to 10 minutes or until slightly pink (medium-rare to medium).

4. **Make the sauce:**
   Discard remaining fat from skillet while breasts are baking. Increase heat to high and add pomegranate molasses and sugar. Cook until sticky, add wine and reduce to a glaze.

5. **Finish the sauce:**
   Add stock, and boil for 3 to 4 minutes or until sauce is thickened and reduced. Add barberries and simmer a few minutes. Remove from heat and swirl in butter.

6. **Serve:**
   Slice breasts and place on plate. Glaze with sauce.

## Notes

- To crack peppercorns and coriander seeds, place in a plastic bag and whack with the back of a pot
- Large moulard duck breasts (about 1 lb each) can serve 2 people
- The slow rendering of duck fat creates crispy skin while keeping the meat tender
- Barberries are tart dried berries available at Middle Eastern markets; dried cranberries can substitute
- Duck is best served medium-rare to medium for optimal tenderness
