### Method

1. **Blanch the beef:**  
   Place brisket pieces in a pot of boiling water for 2–3 minutes to remove impurities. Drain, rinse, and set aside.

2. **Sauté aromatics:**  
   In a large heavy pot or Dutch oven, heat oil over medium heat. Add onion, garlic, and ginger; sauté until fragrant.

3. **Add spices:**  
   Stir in star anise and cinnamon stick; cook for 30 seconds to bloom the aromas.

4. **Deglaze and season:**  
   Add brisket, soy sauces, oyster sauce, Shaoxing wine, and sugar. Stir to coat meat evenly.

5. **Simmer:**  
   Add water or stock to cover. Bring to a boil, then reduce to low and simmer partially covered for 1½–2 hours until beef is tender.

6. **Add daikon and coconut milk:**  
   Stir in daikon pieces and coconut milk. Simmer another 30 minutes until daikon is soft and sauce thickens slightly.

7. **Finish and serve:**  
   Adjust salt to taste. Garnish with scallions or cilantro. Serve hot with steamed rice or noodles.

### Notes
- Optional: Add a small piece of dried tangerine peel for a traditional Cantonese touch.  
- For a lighter version, use half coconut milk and half stock.  
- Tastes even better the next day as the flavors deepen overnight.
