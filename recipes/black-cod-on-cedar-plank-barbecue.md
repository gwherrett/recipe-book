# Black Cod on a Cedar Plank (Barbecue)

A simple, smoky, and tender cedar‑planked black cod (aka sablefish) with a soy–mirin glaze. The plank keeps the fish moist and gently smokes it on the grill.

## Ingredients
- 1 untreated cedar plank (soak in cold water **at least 2 hours**, up to 24)
- 2 black cod (sablefish) fillets, 170–225 g / 6–8 oz each, pin bones removed
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 1/4 cup mirin
- 2 tbsp honey
- 2 tbsp sake (or dry white wine)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp fresh ginger, finely grated
- 1/4 tsp black pepper
- 2 green onions, thinly sliced (for garnish)
- 1 tbsp toasted sesame seeds (for garnish)

## Method
1. **Make glaze.** In a small saucepan, combine soy sauce, mirin, honey, sake, garlic, ginger, and black pepper. Bring to a gentle simmer over medium‑low heat, stirring until the honey dissolves and the sauce thickens slightly, 5–7 minutes. Cool.
2. **Marinate.** Place fillets in a shallow dish. Spoon **half** the cooled glaze over the fish and coat well. Cover and refrigerate 45–60 minutes. Reserve the remaining glaze for basting/serving.
3. **Preheat grill.** Heat barbecue to **400°F / 205°C**. For gas: preheat all burners, then turn one side to low to create an indirect zone.
4. **Set plank.** Pat the soaked cedar plank dry. Place fish on the plank, **skin‑side down**. Discard marinade from the dish.
5. **Grill over indirect heat.** Set the plank on the grill grates over the indirect zone. Close lid and cook **15–20 minutes**, basting once with a little reserved glaze halfway. Target internal temp **130–135°F / 54–57°C** for moist, silky texture (fish should flake but still look glossy in the center).
6. **Finish & serve.** Carefully remove the plank. Rest 2 minutes. Brush with a little more glaze, then garnish with green onion and sesame seeds.

## Notes
- If the plank flames, spritz with water and move it farther from direct heat.
- For stronger smoke, start the plank over direct heat for 2–3 minutes until it lightly smolders, then move to indirect to cook.
- Great sides: steamed rice, grilled asparagus, sesame‑cucumber salad.
