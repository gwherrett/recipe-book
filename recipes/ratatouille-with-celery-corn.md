# Ratatouille with Celery & Corn (No Eggplant)

**Category:** Mains → Vegetables & Stews  
**Tags:** vegetarian, gluten-free, summer, stovetop  
**Serves:** 4  
**Time:** 35–40 minutes

## Summary
A bright, Provençal-inspired ratatouille without eggplant, built around zucchini, peppers, celery, sweet corn, and ripe tomatoes. Celery adds aromatic crunch while corn brings gentle sweetness.

## Ingredients
- 2 medium zucchinis, diced (about 600 g total)
- 1 bell pepper (red or yellow), diced
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 2–3 ripe tomatoes, diced (or 1 × 400 g can diced tomatoes, drained)
- 2 celery stalks, diced
- 1 cup corn kernels (fresh or frozen; if frozen, no need to thaw)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 3 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tsp dried thyme (or 2 tsp fresh, chopped)
- 1 tsp dried rosemary (or 2 tsp fresh, chopped)
- 1 bay leaf (optional)
- ½ tsp chili flakes (optional)
- ¾–1 tsp kosher salt, to taste
- Black pepper, to taste
- Handful fresh basil leaves, torn (for finishing)
- Optional: 1–2 tsp red wine vinegar or lemon juice, for brightness

## Method
1. **Aromatics:** Heat the olive oil in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the onion and a pinch of salt; cook 3–4 minutes until translucent. Stir in garlic for 30 seconds.
2. **Soften veggies:** Add zucchini and cook 5–7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until lightly golden in spots.
3. **Build the stew:** Add bell pepper, celery, tomatoes, thyme, rosemary, bay leaf, chili flakes (if using), ½ tsp more salt, and a few grinds of pepper. Stir and bring to a lively simmer.
4. **Simmer:** Cook 8–10 minutes, uncovered, stirring now and then, until vegetables are tender and the tomatoes have formed a saucy base.
5. **Finish with corn:** Stir in the corn and cook 3–5 minutes more until just tender. Remove bay leaf. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper; add a splash of red wine vinegar or lemon juice if desired.
6. **Serve:** Off heat, fold in torn basil. Serve warm with crusty bread, rice, polenta, or alongside grilled fish/chicken—or keep it vegan as a main.

## Notes
- **Make-ahead:** Keeps 4 days refrigerated. Flavor deepens by day 2. Reheat gently; add a spoon of water if needed.
- **Texture:** For a looser, saucier ratatouille, add ¼ cup water or vegetable stock when simmering. For thicker, cook a few minutes longer to reduce.
- **Substitutions:** Swap basil for parsley or mint. Add olives or capers for briny depth. A pat of butter at the end adds gloss.
- **Protein ideas:** Top with crumbled feta or goat cheese; or add a can of chickpeas during the simmer step.
