# Jamaican Oxtail Stew

## Ingredients
- 3 pounds oxtails, cut into segments by a butcher
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 3 tablespoons light brown sugar
- 2 Spanish onions, peeled and chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
- 3 tablespoons fresh ginger, peeled and chopped
- 1 Scotch bonnet pepper, whole
- 3 sprigs fresh thyme
- 12 allspice berries
- 1 bunch scallions, trimmed and chopped
- 2 tablespoons white sugar
- 3 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- 3 tablespoons flour
- 3 tablespoons tomato ketchup
- 1 cup butter beans (or one 10.5-oz can, rinsed and drained)

## Method
1. Pat the oxtails dry and season aggressively with salt and black pepper.
2. Heat a Dutch oven over high heat. Add brown sugar and melt until dark and smoking. Add 2 tbsp boiling water and stir.
3. Add oxtails in batches, browning well. Remove and keep warm.
4. Add half the onions, garlic, ginger, Scotch bonnet, thyme, allspice, and one-third of the scallions. Cook 5 minutes.
5. Return oxtails and add enough water to nearly submerge. Simmer covered 1 hour.
6. Add white sugar, soy sauce, Worcestershire, remaining onions/scallions, and ketchup. Sprinkle flour and stir to dissolve.
7. Simmer uncovered 45–60 minutes until tender and thickened.
8. Add butter beans and simmer 10 minutes. Remove Scotch bonnet before serving.
9. Adjust seasoning and serve.

## Notes
- Browning the sugar is essential for Jamaican depth and color.
- Add butter beans at the end so they don’t break apart.
