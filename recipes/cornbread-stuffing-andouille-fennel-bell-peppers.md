## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 pounds purchased cornbread, cut into 1-inch cubes  
- 5 tablespoons butter, divided  
- 12 ounces fully cooked andouille sausages (about 4), halved lengthwise, then cut crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces  
- 1 medium fennel bulb, trimmed and cut into 1/2-inch cubes  
- 1 medium onion, cut into 1/2-inch pieces  
- 1 medium red bell pepper, cut into 1/2-inch pieces  
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme  
- 1/4 teaspoon coarse kosher salt, plus more for sprinkling  
- 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more for sprinkling  
- 2 cups low-salt chicken broth  
- 1 large egg  

## Method

1. **Toast the cornbread.**  
   Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350°F (175°C). Spread cornbread cubes in a single layer on a large baking sheet. Bake until dry and lightly browned, 30–45 minutes, stirring once or twice. Let cool completely.  
   *Do ahead: Toasted cornbread can be made 1 day ahead. Store in an airtight container at room temperature.*

2. **Brown the sausage.**  
   Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the andouille pieces and sauté until browned, about 4 minutes. Transfer the sausage to a large mixing bowl.

3. **Cook the vegetables.**  
   In the same skillet, melt the remaining 3 tablespoons butter over medium-high heat. Add the fennel, onion, and red bell pepper. Season lightly with coarse salt and pepper. Sauté, stirring occasionally, until the onion is golden and the vegetables are tender, 10–12 minutes. Transfer the vegetables to the bowl with the sausage.

4. **Assemble the stuffing.**  
   Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) if it’s not already on. Add the toasted cornbread cubes, chopped thyme, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper to the sausage–vegetable mixture. Toss gently to combine without breaking up the cornbread too much.

5. **Add the custard.**  
   In a medium bowl, whisk together the chicken broth and egg until well blended. Pour the broth mixture over the cornbread mixture and toss gently until evenly moistened.

6. **Bake.**  
   Transfer the stuffing mixture to a 13x9x2-inch (approx. 3 L) glass or ceramic baking dish. Spread into an even layer. Bake, uncovered, until heated through and the top is crisp and golden, about 1 hour. If the top is browning too quickly, tent loosely with foil.

7. **Rest and serve.**  
   Let the stuffing stand for about 15 minutes before serving to set slightly. Serve warm.

## Notes

- For a slightly drier stuffing, reduce the broth to 1 3/4 cups. For a moister, more spoonable stuffing, add up to 1/4 cup additional broth.
