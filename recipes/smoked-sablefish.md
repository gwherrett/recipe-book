### 1. Prep the Fish
- Keep the skin on — it helps hold the fillet together.  
- Pat dry and season lightly with salt, pepper, and maybe a touch of smoked paprika if you want to boost the smokiness.  
- Optional: brine (1 L water, ¼ cup kosher salt, 2 tbsp brown sugar) for 30–60 minutes to firm the flesh and help it take smoke evenly. Rinse and dry after.

### 2. Set Up the BBQ for Smoking
- Use a gas or charcoal grill with an **indirect zone**.  
- Keep temperature around **200–225°F (95–110°C)**.  
- Add soaked wood chips — **alder, apple, or cherry** work best for sablefish. Avoid heavy woods like hickory or mesquite.

### 3. Smoke the Fish
- Place sablefish **skin-side down** on a well-oiled grill tray, foil, or cedar plank to prevent sticking.  
- Close the lid and smoke gently for **30–45 minutes**, depending on thickness, until internal temp reaches **140–145°F (60–63°C)**.  
- Don’t flip — the flesh is delicate.

### 4. Finish & Serve
- Brush with glaze in the last 10 minutes (try soy-maple, miso-mirin, or smoky butter-lemon).  
- Serve with chowders, roasted vegetables, or rice — the buttery flesh pairs beautifully with creamy, smoky, or slightly sweet sides.

---

**Notes:**
- Brining helps the sablefish stay moist and enhances the smoky flavor.  
- For deeper smoke, add more wood chips halfway through cooking.  
- Leftovers make excellent smoked sablefish pâté or rice bowls.
