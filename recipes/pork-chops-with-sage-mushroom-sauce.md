- Salt and pepper
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tbsp butter

### For the Sage Mushroom Sauce:
- 1 tbsp butter (additional)
- 1 tbsp olive oil (optional, for sautéing)
- 8 oz (225g) cremini or button mushrooms, sliced

## 🔪 Instructions

1. **Season & Sear the Pork Chops:**
   - Pat pork chops dry. Season both sides with salt and pepper.

   - Deglaze with white wine or broth, scraping up any brown bits.
   - Simmer 2 minutes until slightly reduced.
   - Add cream. Simmer gently for 3–4 minutes until thickened slightly. Season with salt, pepper, and a splash of lemon juice or vinegar if desired.

3. **Return Pork Chops:**
   - Return chops (with any juices) to the pan. Spoon sauce overtop.
   - Simmer 2 minutes to reheat and meld flavors.
