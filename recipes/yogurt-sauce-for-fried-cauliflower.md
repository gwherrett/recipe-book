# Yogurt Sauce for Fried Cauliflower

## Ingredients
- 1 cup plain yogurt (Greek or regular)
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 teaspoon honey or maple syrup (optional, for a touch of sweetness)
- 1 tablespoon fresh dill or parsley, finely chopped (you can also use mint)
- Salt and pepper, to taste

## Instructions
1. **Combine Ingredients**: In a bowl, mix together the yogurt, minced garlic, lemon juice, olive oil, and honey/maple syrup if using.
2. **Add Herbs**: Stir in the fresh dill or parsley. You can use mint or a mix for variation.
3. **Season**: Add salt and pepper to taste. Adjust seasoning as needed.
4. **Chill**: Place the yogurt sauce in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes before serving. This allows the flavors to meld together.
5. **Serve**: Drizzle the yogurt sauce over the fried cauliflower or serve it on the side for dipping.

### Notes
- This sauce also pairs beautifully with grilled vegetables, falafel, or roasted meats.
- For a spicier version, add a pinch of cayenne or a spoonful of zhoug or harissa.
