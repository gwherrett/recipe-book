## Instructions

1. **Cook the Taro Root**  
   Cut the taro into slices and stir-fry it lightly. Add the chicken broth powder, 5-flavor powder, white pepper, salt, and light soy sauce. Add 2 1/2 cups of water and cook in a covered pot over low heat until the taro is soft and mashable. Turn off the heat.

2. **Prepare the Meat Mixture**  
   In a separate pan, stir-fry the Chinese sausage, dried pork, and soaked mushrooms. Season with soy sauce, sugar, and rice wine.

3. **Combine**  
   Add the cooked meat mixture to the taro root.

4. **Make the Batter**  
   Mix the rice flour with 3 1/2 cups of water until smooth. Combine the flour mixture with the taro-meat mixture and mix well.

5. **Steam the Cake**  
   Lightly oil a pan or dish. Pour in the mixture. Steam over hot water for about 40 minutes.

## Notes

- If you'd like to retain some taro texture, remove some of the taro midway through cooking and set aside. Return it to the mixture later so you get a mix of mashed and diced pieces.
- Serve warm or pan-fry slices after chilling for a crisp exterior.
