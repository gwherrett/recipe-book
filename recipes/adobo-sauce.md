**Mexican Adobo Sauce**

**Summary:**  
A rich, smoky, and tangy Mexican sauce made from dried chili peppers, garlic, vinegar, and spices. This versatile sauce serves as a flavorful marinade for meats like chicken or pork, or as a base for stews, enchiladas, and tamales.

### Ingredients
- 3 dried ancho chilies
- 3 dried guajillo chilies
- 2-3 chipotle chilies (optional, for extra heat)
- 4 cloves garlic
- 1/2 cup apple cider or white vinegar
- 1 tsp dried oregano (preferably Mexican oregano)
- 1/2 tsp ground cumin
- 1/4 tsp ground cloves
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 1 tsp salt
- 1-2 tsp sugar (optional, to balance acidity)
- 1/2 cup orange juice or water

### Method
1. **Prepare the Chilies:** Remove stems and seeds from the dried chilies. Toast lightly in a dry skillet over medium heat until fragrant (about 30 seconds per side). Cover with hot water and soak for 20–30 minutes, until softened.
2. **Blend the Sauce:** Drain the chilies and place them in a blender with garlic, vinegar, oregano, cumin, cloves, black pepper, salt, sugar, and orange juice (or water). Blend until smooth, adding a little soaking liquid if needed for consistency.
3. **Simmer to Finish:** Pour the blended sauce into a saucepan and simmer over medium-low heat for 10–15 minutes to meld flavors.
4. **Store:** Let cool, then store in a glass jar or airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. You can also freeze in portions for longer storage.

### Uses
- Marinade for chicken, pork, or beef (e.g., **Adobo-Marinated Chicken**)
- Sauce for enchiladas, tacos, or tamales
- Flavor base for soups and stews (like **Pozole**)
- Add a spoonful to salsa or mayo for smoky depth

**Notes:**  
Adjust chili blend for your preferred heat level. Anchos provide sweetness, guajillos offer bright acidity, and chipotles add smokiness. Strain sauce for extra-smooth texture if desired.
