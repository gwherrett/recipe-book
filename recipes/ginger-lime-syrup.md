# ginger-lime-syrup-jean-georges

A bright, concentrated ginger–lime syrup inspired by Jean‑Georges—made with **less water** for punchier flavor. Great in cocktails, sodas, and dressings.

## Ingredients
- 1 cup (200 g) sugar
- **2/3 cup (160 ml) water** *(reduced for stronger syrup)*
- 1/4 cup (30 g) fresh ginger, peeled and thinly sliced or chopped
- 1/4 cup (60 ml) fresh lime juice
- Finely grated zest of 1 lime
- Optional: small pinch of salt (enhances brightness)

## Method
1. Combine sugar and water in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir until the sugar dissolves and the mixture just begins to simmer.
2. Add the ginger; maintain a gentle simmer for **8–10 minutes** to extract flavor.
3. Remove from heat. Stir in lime zest; let steep **15 minutes**.
4. Strain through a fine‑mesh sieve, pressing gently on the ginger. Stir in the lime juice (and a small pinch of salt, if using).
5. Cool, bottle, and refrigerate for up to **3 weeks**.

## Use It For
- Ginger‑lime soda: 30–45 ml syrup + sparkling water over ice
- Cocktails: pairs with gin, tequila, rum, or whiskey
- Dressings & marinades: whisk with neutral oil and a splash of rice vinegar

## Notes
- For even more intensity, reduce water to **1/2 cup (120 ml)** and extend the ginger simmer to **12 minutes**.
- Yields ~1 1/4 cups (300 ml), depending on reduction.
