# Carrot Salad with Dates, Pistachios & Tahini-Lemon Dressing

A bright, crunchy carrot salad with chewy dates, toasted pistachios, and a creamy tahini-lemon dressing. Great as a side dish or a make-ahead lunch; it keeps well for 2–3 days in the fridge.

## Ingredients

### Salad

- 1 lb (450 g) carrots, peeled and julienned or shredded  
- 3 Medjool dates, pitted and finely chopped  
- ¼ cup (30 g) pistachios, roughly chopped  
- ⅓ cup (10–15 g) finely chopped cilantro (coriander leaves)  
- ¼ cup loosely packed mint leaves, torn or sliced (optional)  

### Tahini-Lemon Dressing

- 2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil  
- 2 tbsp fresh lemon juice  
- 1 tbsp tahini  
- 1 tbsp honey or maple syrup  
- 1 small garlic clove, grated or very finely minced  
- ¼ tsp ground cumin  
- ¼ tsp fine sea salt, plus more to taste  
- 1–2 tsp water, as needed to thin  

## Method

1. **Prep the salad base**  
   Add the **julienned carrots** to a large mixing bowl. Sprinkle over the **chopped dates**.

2. **Make the dressing**  
   In a small bowl, whisk together the **olive oil**, **lemon juice**, **tahini**, **honey**, **garlic**, **cumin**, and **salt** until smooth.  
   If the dressing is very thick, whisk in **1–2 teaspoons of water** until it reaches a pourable consistency.

3. **Dress the salad**  
   Pour the dressing over the carrots and dates. Toss well until everything is lightly and evenly coated.

4. **Add herbs and pistachios**  
   Add the **chopped pistachios**, **cilantro**, and **mint (if using)**. Toss again to distribute.

5. **Taste & adjust**  
   Taste and adjust seasoning with a pinch more **salt** or **lemon juice** if needed.

6. **Serve or store**  
   Serve immediately, or let it sit for 10–15 minutes for the flavors to meld.  
   Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to **3 days**.

## Notes

- For extra crunch, reserve a spoonful of **pistachios** to sprinkle on just before serving.  
- Swap dates for **dried apricots** or **golden raisins** if you like.  
- Add **crumbled feta** on top if you want a slightly richer salad (adjust health rating accordingly).
