# Proper Italian Bolognese Sauce

A rich and traditional Italian meat sauce from Bologna, known as *Ragù
alla Bolognese*. Slow-simmered with beef, pork, and pancetta for deep
flavor, balanced with milk for richness.

## Ingredients

-   1 tbsp olive oil\
-   1 medium onion, finely chopped\
-   1 celery stalk, finely chopped\
-   1 carrot, finely chopped\
-   2 cloves garlic, minced\
-   8 oz ground beef\
-   8 oz ground pork\
-   4 oz pancetta, finely chopped\
-   1/2 cup dry white wine\
-   1 cup whole milk\
-   1 can (14 oz) crushed tomatoes\
-   2 tbsp tomato paste\
-   1 bay leaf\
-   1/4 tsp ground nutmeg\
-   Salt and pepper to taste\
-   Freshly grated Parmesan cheese, for serving\
-   Cooked pasta of choice (tagliatelle or pappardelle recommended)

## Method

1.  Heat olive oil in a heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat.\
2.  Add pancetta and cook until lightly browned and fat has rendered.\
3.  Add onion, celery, carrot, and garlic; sauté until softened (5--7
    minutes).\
4.  Increase heat to medium-high. Add beef and pork, breaking apart with
    a wooden spoon until browned.\
5.  Pour in wine and simmer until mostly evaporated.\
6.  Stir in tomatoes, tomato paste, milk, bay leaf, and nutmeg. Season
    with salt and pepper.\
7.  Reduce heat to low, cover partially, and simmer gently for 2--3
    hours, stirring occasionally.\
8.  Remove bay leaf, adjust seasoning, and serve over pasta with
    Parmesan.

## Notes

-   The milk softens the acidity of the tomatoes and gives a richer
    flavor.\
-   For an authentic pairing, serve with **tagliatelle** and a glass of
    **Sangiovese**.
