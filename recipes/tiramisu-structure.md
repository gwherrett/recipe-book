# Tiramisu Structure

A concise reference to the classic layered architecture of tiramisu, plus practical ratios, assembly notes, and common variations.

---

## Overview

Tiramisu is an **assembled, no-bake** dessert built from alternating layers of **coffee-soaked ladyfingers** and **mascarpone cream**, finished with a **cocoa dusting**. Proper texture comes from quick soaking, gentle folding, and adequate chilling.

---

## Core Components

1. **Ladyfingers (Savoiardi)**  
   - Dry, airy sponge biscuits that absorb coffee without collapsing.  
   - Soak in **strong espresso**; optional splash of **Marsala**, rum, or coffee liqueur.

2. **Mascarpone Cream** (classic)  
   - Mascarpone + egg yolks + sugar; often lightened with whipped egg whites or whipped cream.  
   - Some modern versions use **whipped cream only** (no raw egg).

3. **Finish**  
   - Unsweetened **cocoa powder** (sifted just before serving).  
   - Optional: fine **dark chocolate shavings**.

## Typical Layer Order (Top → Bottom)

- Cocoa powder  
- Mascarpone cream  
- Coffee-soaked ladyfingers  
- Mascarpone cream  
- Coffee-soaked ladyfingers  
- (Base of dish)

> Most home pans use **2 biscuit layers + 2 cream layers**; add more if your dish is deep.

---

## Practical Ratios (9×13 in / 23×33 cm pan)

- **Ladyfingers:** ~40–48 (2 sleeves, ~400–450 g)  
- **Espresso/coffee soak:** 1½–2 cups (350–475 ml), lightly sweetened; add 2–4 tbsp Marsala (optional)  
- **Mascarpone:** 500 g  
- **Eggs:** 4 large yolks (plus 3 whites whipped *or* 300 ml heavy cream whipped)  
- **Sugar:** 90–120 g (to taste)  
- **Cocoa powder:** 2–3 tbsp for finishing

> For an 8–9 in (20–23 cm) square pan, use **20–24 ladyfingers + 250 g mascarpone**.

---

## Soaking Guidance

- Use **cold or room-temp** coffee (hot coffee over-softens).  
- **Dip quickly**: ~1–2 seconds per side. The center should stay a bit dry; it hydrates during chilling.  
- Mix alcohol into the coffee—don’t drizzle separately.

---

## Mascarpone Cream Methods

**Classic sabayon (richer):**  
1. Whisk yolks + sugar over a gentle bain-marie until thick, pale, ~70–75 °C.  
2. Off heat, whisk in mascarpone until smooth.  
3. Fold in whipped egg whites *or* whipped cream.

**No-egg / lighter:**  
- Whisk mascarpone + powdered sugar; fold in softly whipped cream.

**Stability tips:**  
- Mascarpone cold but pliable. Over-whipping causes splitting.  
- Fold gently to keep volume.

---

## Assembly Steps

1. Smear a thin layer of cream on the dish base (anchors biscuits).  
2. Arrange a snug layer of **briefly dipped** ladyfingers.  
3. Spread **half** the cream.  
4. Repeat biscuits + remaining cream.  
5. Cover; **chill 6–24 hours** (overnight is best).  
6. Sift cocoa just before serving; slice with a hot, dry knife.

## Texture & Flavor Targets

- **Biscuit bite:** Soft, not soggy; layers hold when sliced.  
- **Cream:** Light, mousse-like; not runny.  
- **Balance:** Bitter cocoa/coffee, gentle sweetness, dairy richness, optional alcohol.

---

## Variations & Swaps

- **Alcohol-free:** Coffee only; add a drop of vanilla.  
- **Egg-free:** Use whipped cream instead of eggs.  
- **Tea-misu:** Use strong black tea or matcha (sweeten slightly).  
- **Chocolate-forward:** Ripple in 50–75 g melted dark chocolate.  
- **Fruit accent:** Thin berries or macerated stone fruit between cream layers (sparingly).

### Greek Yogurt, Lime & Ginger (lighter riff)
- Replace half (or all) mascarpone with **strained Greek yogurt** (hang in cheesecloth 2–12 h).  
- Fold in **lime zest** (1–2 tsp) and **fresh micro-planed ginger** (½–1 tsp), plus honey/sugar to taste.  
- Keep coffee soak classic or add a whisper of lime peel.  
- Assemble and chill thoroughly for flavors to meld.

> Yogurt adds tang and a lighter body; **strain well** for clean slices.

---

## Make-Ahead, Storage, Safety

- **Make-ahead:** Best after **12–24 h**; up to 36 h before serving.  
- **Storage:** Refrigerate airtight up to **3 days**.  
- **Freezing:** Possible but softens texture; thaw overnight.  
- **Safety:** If using raw eggs, use **pasteurized** or cook yolks as a sabayon.

---

## Quick Troubleshooting

- **Soggy / collapsing:** Over-soaked biscuits → dip faster; use colder coffee.  
- **Runny cream:** Under-whipped or over-mixed → chill bowl; fold gently.  
- **Grainy/split cream:** Over-whipped mascarpone → fold in a little cold cream to rescue.

### At-a-Glance Checklist
- Strong coffee cooled  
- Dip fast (1–2 s/side)  
- Cream mixed without over-whipping  
- Overnight chill  
- Cocoa right before serving
