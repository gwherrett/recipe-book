## Ingredients
- 3/4 cup (180 ml) **sour orange** juice (or 1/2 orange juice + 1/2 lime juice)
- 5 garlic cloves, **finely minced** (or grated)
- 1/2 cup (120 ml) **olive oil**
- 1 tsp **ground cumin**
- 1 tsp **dried oregano**
- 1–1 1/2 tsp **kosher salt**, to taste
- 1/2 tsp **black pepper**
- Optional: 1/4 cup **fresh cilantro**, chopped
- Optional heat: pinch **red pepper flakes**

## Method
1. In a bowl, combine the sour orange juice (or orange + lime), garlic, cumin, oregano, salt, and pepper.  
2. Warm the olive oil in a small pan until shimmering (not smoking). Carefully whisk the hot oil into the citrus mixture.  
3. Stir in cilantro (and red pepper flakes if using). Let cool completely before using.  
4. **Marinate**:  
   - Pork shoulder/pernil: 8–24 hours (refrigerated).  
   - Pork chops or chicken pieces: 2–12 hours.  
   - Fish or shrimp: 20–45 minutes.  
5. Discard used marinade. For extra flavor, reserve a small portion **before** contacting raw meat and use it as a finishing sauce.

## Notes & Tips
- **Sour orange substitute:** Mix equal parts fresh orange juice and lime juice to approximate *naranja agria*.  
- **Yield:** ~1 3/4 cups (about 415 ml), enough for ~1.5–2 kg meat. Scale as needed.  
- **Make-ahead:** Keeps 4–5 days refrigerated in a sealed jar. The oil may separate; shake well.  
- **Serving ideas:** Use with Cuban roast pork (pernil), grilled chicken, or drizzle (reserved clean mojo) over yuca con mojo or roasted vegetables.
