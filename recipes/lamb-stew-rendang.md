# Lamb Stew Rendang

**Category:** Mains → Stews & Curries  
**Tags:** Indonesian, lamb, coconut, spicy, slow-cooked

**Summary:** A rich, aromatic West Sumatran–style rendang made with tender lamb gently simmered in spiced coconut milk until the sauce reduces and coats the meat. Balanced heat, deep caramelized notes, and a citrusy lift from lemongrass and kaffir/turmeric leaves.

**Time:** Active 25–30 min · Simmer 2–3 hrs (mostly hands-off)  
**Yield:** Serves 4–6

## Ingredients

### Lamb & Braise
- 800 g lamb shoulder or leg, cut into 4–5 cm chunks
- 400 ml full‑fat coconut milk (1 can)
- 200 ml water (or light stock)
- 2 stalks lemongrass, bruised and knotted
- 3 kaffir lime leaves *(or 1 turmeric leaf, or both if available)*
- 1½ tbsp tamarind paste (or 1 tbsp lime juice)
- 1 tsp fine salt, plus more to taste
- 2 tsp palm sugar or brown sugar

### Spice Paste (Bumbu)
- 6–8 dried red chilies, soaked until soft & seeded *(or 3–4 fresh red chilies)*
- 6 shallots
- 4 cloves garlic
- 25 g fresh ginger, sliced
- 25 g fresh galangal, sliced
- 15 g fresh turmeric (or 1 tsp ground)
- 1 tsp ground coriander
- ½ tsp ground cumin
- 3 tbsp neutral oil (for sautéing)

> **Tip:** If you can’t find galangal, use extra ginger and a little lime zest as a rough stand‑in.

## Method

1. **Make the spice paste.** Blend chilies, shallots, garlic, ginger, galangal, turmeric, coriander, and cumin with a splash of water until smooth.
2. **Brown the paste.** Heat oil in a heavy pot (Dutch oven). Sauté the paste over medium heat 6–8 minutes until thickened, glossy, and aromatic; it should darken slightly and no longer smell raw.
3. **Add aromatics & liquids.** Stir in coconut milk and water, then add lemongrass, kaffir/turmeric leaves, tamarind, salt, and sugar. Bring to a gentle simmer.
4. **Add lamb.** Nestle in the lamb pieces. Simmer uncovered on low, stirring every 10–15 minutes to prevent sticking. Adjust heat to maintain a lazy bubble.
5. **Slow reduce.** After ~90 minutes, the liquid will have reduced and fat will begin to separate. Continue cooking 30–60 minutes more, stirring more frequently, until the sauce is thick, glossy, and clings to the lamb. The color should deepen to reddish‑brown.
6. **Finish & rest.** When the lamb is very tender and the sauce is nearly dry (rendang kering) or thick and spoonable (kalio), remove lemongrass/leaf stems. Rest 10 minutes, then taste and adjust salt/sourness.

## Serve With
- Steamed jasmine rice or coconut rice  
- Quick cucumber salad or pickles (acar)  
- Toasted shredded coconut (serundeng), optional

## Notes & Variations
- **Heat:** Add bird’s‑eye chilies to taste.  
- **Make‑ahead:** Rendang tastes even better the next day. Refrigerate up to 4 days or freeze up to 3 months.  
- **Coconut:** For a richer finish, stir in 50–100 ml coconut cream in the last 5 minutes.  
- **Texture:** Stop earlier for **kalio** (saucy). Cook longer for **rendang kering** (nearly dry, intensely flavored).  
- **Substitutions:** Beef chuck works perfectly with the same method; chicken thighs need only ~60–75 minutes total.

## Scaling
- For 2–3 servings, halve all ingredients and use a smaller pot to maintain surface area for reduction.
- For a crowd, double the recipe but cook in a wide Dutch oven or two pots so it reduces properly.
