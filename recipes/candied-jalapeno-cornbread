# Jalapeño Cornbread with Brown Butter Jalapeño Honey

Cheesy, jalapeño-studded cornbread with a glossy brown-butter topping spiked with jalapeño jam (or cowboy candy) or honey. One bowl, very dangerous warm out of the pan.

## Ingredients

### Cornbread

- 3 large eggs  
- 100 g unsalted butter, melted (plus more for greasing the pan)  
- 60 ml milk (oat milk works well)  
- 200 g tinned creamed corn  
- 100 g mature cheddar, grated  
- 120 g quick-cook polenta  
- 1/4 tsp fine salt  
- 1 tbsp caster sugar  
- 125 g gluten-free flour  
- 1 tbsp baking powder  
- 5 jalapeños  
  - 2 finely diced  
  - 3 sliced into rounds for the top  

### Topping

- 60 g salted butter  
- 2 tbsp jalapeño jam, cowboy candy, **or** honey  

> Note: Any good candied jalapeños / jalapeño jam works here. Honey alone is also great in a pinch.

## Method

1. **Heat the oven & prepare the pan**  
   - Preheat oven to **180°C fan / 200°C conventional**.  
   - Use a **24 cm cast iron skillet** or round tin.  
   - Grease the pan liberally with butter.

2. **Make the batter (one bowl)**  
   - In a large bowl, whisk the **eggs** well.  
   - Whisk in the **melted unsalted butter**, **milk**, and **creamed corn** until combined.  
   - Add the **grated cheddar**, **polenta**, **sugar**, and **salt**.  
   - Stir and let sit for **5 minutes** so the polenta hydrates slightly.

3. **Add jalapeños & dry ingredients**  
   - Stir in the **finely diced jalapeños**.  
   - Add the **gluten-free flour** and **baking powder** and mix just until you have a smooth, even batter.

4. **Bake**  
   - Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top.  
   - Scatter the **sliced jalapeño rounds** evenly over the surface.  
   - Bake for **20–25 minutes**, until golden and a skewer comes out clean.  
     - If you preheated the skillet, start checking at **20 minutes**.

5. **Make the brown butter topping**  
   - While the cornbread bakes (or just after it comes out), place the **salted butter** in a small pan.  
   - Melt over medium heat and cook until the butter foams and the milk solids turn **light brown** and nutty.  
   - Remove from the heat and stir in the **jalapeño jam / cowboy candy** or **honey** until smooth.

6. **Finish & serve**  
   - As soon as the cornbread comes out of the oven, pour or spoon the **warm brown butter topping** evenly over the surface.  
   - Let rest for **5 minutes**, then slice and serve warm.
