## 🫕 Method

1. **Brown the shanks**  
   Heat oil in a heavy Dutch oven. Sear shanks on all sides until browned. Remove and set aside.

2. **Sauté aromatics**  
   Add onions and cook 8–10 min until golden. Add garlic, paprika, turmeric, and cinnamon; cook 2 min until fragrant. Stir in tomato paste and cardamom (if using).

3. **Deglaze & build the base**  
   Pour in ½ cup stock to loosen browned bits. Return shanks, add remaining stock, saffron liquid, salt, pepper, sugar, and optional cinnamon stick/cloves.  
   The liquid should come halfway up the shanks.

4. **Slow-braise**  
   Cover tightly and simmer on low for 2½–3 hr (turning occasionally) until meat is tender and falling off the bone. Add a splash of water if needed.

5. **Finish & balance**  
   Remove shanks. Reduce sauce uncovered 10–15 min to a glossy consistency.  
   Stir in lemon juice *(off heat)*. Taste and adjust seasoning.

6. **Serve beautifully**  
   Spoon sauce over shanks. Serve with saffron rice or creamy mash. Garnish with mint, parsley, and orange or mandarin zest.

## 🌿 Chef’s Notes
- **Oven method:** Cook covered at 160 °C / 325 °F for 3 hr.  
- **Make-ahead:** Improves overnight; reheat gently with a splash of stock.  
- **Modern plating:** Reduce sauce to a jus; finish with micro-greens or a sprinkle of sumac for contrast.
