# Turkey Adobo (Filipino)

**Summary:** A deeper, richer take on classic Filipino adobo using turkey thighs. Turkey handles braising beautifully—extra collagen means a glossy, velvety sauce and meat that becomes fall-apart tender.  
**Time:** 75–95 minutes (plus optional marinating)  
**Serves:** 4–6

## Ingredients
- 2.5–3 lb (1.1–1.4 kg) turkey thighs, bone-in skin-on (2–3 large pieces)
- 1/2 cup (125 ml) soy sauce  
- 1/2 cup (125 ml) white or cane vinegar  
- 1/2 cup (125 ml) water or unsalted stock  
- 1 head garlic, peeled and minced (8–10 cloves)  
- 1 medium onion, sliced  
- 2 bay leaves  
- 1 tbsp whole black peppercorns (lightly crushed)  
- 1 tbsp brown sugar (optional, to balance acidity)  
- 1–2 tbsp neutral oil (for sautéing)  
- Salt, to taste  
- Sliced green onion or cilantro (optional)  
- Steamed rice, to serve

## Method

1. **Marinate (optional, 30 min–overnight):**  
   Mix soy sauce, vinegar, water, garlic, bay leaves, peppercorns, and optional brown sugar. Add turkey thighs and coat well.

2. **Render & brown:**  
   Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium. Place turkey thighs skin-side down and let the fat render for 5–7 minutes until browned. Flip and brown the other side.

3. **Sauté aromatics:**  
   Push turkey aside or remove briefly. Add onion and cook 2–3 minutes until softened. Return turkey if removed.

4. **Add marinade & simmer:**  
   Pour in the reserved marinade. Bring to a boil, then reduce to low. Cover and simmer 55–75 minutes, turning occasionally, until the turkey is tender and pulls easily from the bone.

5. **Reduce sauce:**  
   Remove turkey to a plate. Simmer sauce uncovered 10–15 minutes until slightly thick and glossy. Return turkey to coat.

6. **Finish & serve:**  
   Adjust salt or add a small pinch of sugar to balance acidity. Serve over steamed rice with green onion or cilantro.

## Notes & Variations
- **Coconut Adobo (Adobo sa Gata):** Add 1/2 cup coconut milk in the last 10 minutes for a richer, creamier sauce.  
- **Crispy Finish Option:** After braising, broil turkey thighs for 2–3 minutes to crisp the skin, then return to the sauce.  
- **Richer Gravy:** Because turkey throws more collagen, you can reduce the sauce further for a near-lacquered glaze.  
- **Make-Ahead:** Turkey adobo tastes even better the next day—fat rises and can be skimmed for a cleaner sauce.
