# Japanese Curry Powder

## Description
Japanese curry powder is a fragrant spice blend used to make rich and flavorful Japanese-style curries. Unlike Indian curry powder, it has a slightly sweeter, milder profile with warm spices that balance beautifully with savory dishes. This homemade version lets you customize the flavors to suit your taste.

## Instructions
1. **Toast the whole spices** (coriander, cumin, fennel, fenugreek, mustard) in a dry pan over medium heat until fragrant, about 1–2 minutes. Be careful not to burn them.  
2. Let the spices cool slightly, then grind them into a fine powder using a spice grinder or mortar and pestle.  
3. In a small bowl, combine the ground spices with the pre-ground turmeric, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, and black pepper. Add optional cayenne or smoked paprika, if desired.  
4. Mix well to ensure the spices are evenly distributed.  
5. Store in an airtight container in a cool, dark place for up to 6 months.
