# Hot Sausage and Peppers Pasta

## Ingredients
- 12 oz (340g) pasta (penne, rigatoni, or any other you prefer)
- 1 lb (450g) hot Italian sausage (casings removed)
- 1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced
- 1 yellow bell pepper, thinly sliced
- 1 onion, thinly sliced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 can (14.5 oz) diced tomatoes
- 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes (optional for extra heat)
- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- Fresh basil or parsley (for garnish)
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions
1. **Cook the pasta:** Boil salted water in a large pot. Cook the pasta according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside, reserving 1/2 cup of pasta water.

2. **Cook the sausage:** In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add the sausage, breaking it into small pieces as it cooks. Cook until browned and fully cooked through, about 7-8 minutes. Remove sausage from the skillet and set aside.

3. **Sauté the peppers and onion:** In the same skillet, add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil. Add the bell peppers and onion. Cook, stirring occasionally, until they soften and begin to caramelize, about 8-10 minutes. Add garlic and cook for another minute.

4. **Combine sausage and tomatoes:** Add the cooked sausage back into the skillet with the vegetables. Pour in the diced tomatoes and red pepper flakes, stirring to combine. Let it simmer for 5 minutes to let the flavors meld. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

5. **Toss with pasta:** Add the drained pasta to the skillet, tossing everything together. If the sauce is too thick, add a bit of the reserved pasta water to loosen it up.

6. **Serve:** Top with grated Parmesan and fresh basil or parsley. Serve immediately.
