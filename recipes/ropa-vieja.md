# Ropa Vieja (with Trinity Base)

**Category:** Mains → Stews & Braises  
**Tags:** Cuban, beef, trinity, braised

**Summary:**  
A Cuban classic made with flank steak simmered until tender in a tomato-based sauce built on a sautéed "holy trinity" of onions, celery, and bell peppers. Flavored with cumin, paprika, olives, and capers for a deeply savory and slightly tangy finish. Best served over rice or with plantains.

## Instructions

### Prepare the Steak  
Season the flank steak with salt and pepper on both sides.  
Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat.  
Sear the steak for 3-4 minutes per side until browned. Remove and set aside.

### Sauté the Trinity  
Add the remaining olive oil to the pot.  
Sauté the onions, celery, and green bell pepper until softened, about 5-7 minutes.  
Stir in the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.

### Add Spices and Liquid  
Stir in the cumin, smoked paprika, oregano, and tomato paste, cooking for 1 minute.  
Add the crushed tomatoes, beef broth, and bay leaves. Stir to combine.

### Cook the Beef  
Return the steak to the pot, ensuring it is submerged.  
Bring to a simmer, cover, and reduce heat to low.  
Cook for 2½ to 3 hours, until the steak is tender and shreds easily.

### Shred the Beef  
Remove the steak, shred using two forks, and return it to the pot.

### Add Final Touches  
Stir in olives, capers, and vinegar. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.  
Simmer uncovered for 10–15 minutes to meld flavors.

### Serve  
Garnish with fresh cilantro or parsley.  
Serve over rice, with fried plantains, or warm tortillas.
