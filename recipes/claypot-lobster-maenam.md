## Method

1. **Par‑cook the lobster (if live):** Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add lobster and cook 5–6 minutes for 700–900 g (the meat will finish in the claypot). Cool slightly, split lengthwise, crack claws, and remove the tomalley if you like. Cut tail into 3–4 pieces.
2. **Build aromatic stock:** In a claypot or heavy 24–26 cm pot, warm oil over medium heat. Sauté garlic and shallot 1–2 min until fragrant. Add lemongrass, galangal, kaffir lime leaves, chilies, white pepper, and crushed coriander; stir 30 sec. Add stock and coconut milk. Simmer gently 8–10 min to infuse.
3. **Season:** Stir in chili jam and palm sugar. Add fish sauce to taste (start with 2 tbsp). Simmer 2 min.
4. **Add noodles:** Nest the soaked, drained glass noodles in the pot so they’re mostly submerged. Simmer 3–4 min until starting to turn translucent.
5. **Poach lobster to finish:** Lay the lobster pieces (and any juices) over the noodles. Cover and cook at a lively simmer 4–6 min until the meat is just opaque and springy.
6. **Herbs & brightness:** Remove from heat. Stir in lime juice and sesame oil (if using). Fold in Thai basil, half the cilantro, green peppercorns, and most of the scallions.
7. **Serve:** Scatter remaining cilantro and scallions on top. Bring the claypot straight to the table with extra lime wedges.

## Notes & Tips

- **Maenam‑style cues:** Balance is key—salty (fish sauce), sweet (palm sugar), sour (lime), spicy (chilies & chili jam), aromatic (lemongrass/galangal/kaffir). Adjust each at the end until the sauce sings.
- **No live lobster?** Use 450–600 g (1–1¼ lb) cooked lobster meat/claws/tails. Skip Step 1 and warm gently in Step 5 for 2–3 min.
- **Stock swap:** A light prawn‑shell stock is fantastic. If using a rich stock, cut back to 350 ml and increase coconut milk by 50 ml.
- **Glass noodles:** Rinse after soaking to remove starch; they’ll finish in the pot and drink up the sauce.
- **Vegetable add‑ins (optional):** A handful of baby bok choy, snap peas, or enoki mushrooms can be added with the noodles.
- **Make‑ahead:** Stock base (through Step 3) keeps 3 days refrigerated. Reheat, add noodles and lobster to finish.
- **Allergy note:** Fish sauce contains anchovy; substitute light soy + pinch salt if needed (flavor will differ).

## Scaling

- **For 4–5 servings:** Use 2 small lobsters (600–700 g each), 120 g noodles, 600 ml stock, 300 ml coconut milk; increase seasonings by ~50% and cook in a larger claypot or Dutch oven.

## Pairing

- **Rice:** Steamed jasmine alongside (to catch extra sauce).  
- **Wine/beer:** Off‑dry Riesling or a crisp pilsner.
