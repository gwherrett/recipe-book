## Instructions

1. **Prepare the green beans:** Wash and trim the ends. Pat dry thoroughly to avoid splattering.
2. **Stir-fry the beans:** Heat 1 tbsp oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Add green beans and stir-fry 5–7 min until blistered and slightly charred. Remove and set aside.
3. **Cook aromatics:** In the same wok, heat 1 tbsp oil. Lower heat to medium. Add garlic, ginger, and Sichuan peppercorns. Stir-fry 30 sec until fragrant.
4. **Add protein and pastes:** If using pork or chicken, add now and cook until browned. Stir in doubanjiang, mustard greens, and dried chilies. Cook 1–2 min to deepen flavors.
5. **Combine & season:** Return green beans. Add soy sauces, sugar, sesame oil. Stir to coat evenly.
6. **Steam to finish:** Add 1/4 cup water. Cover and steam 2–3 min. Uncover, stir-fry another minute until liquid evaporates.
7. **Serve:** Garnish with more ground Sichuan peppercorn if desired. Serve hot with rice.

## Notes
- For vegetarian/vegan version, omit the pork.
- Doubanjiang is salty—adjust soy sauce accordingly.
