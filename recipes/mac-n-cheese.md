## Instructions

1. Heat a large pot of salted water. While waiting for it to boil, start preparing your cheese sauce.  
2. In a large saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Whisk in flour and cook for 2 minutes. Gradually pour in the milk while whisking continuously until smooth. Continue cooking until the sauce thickens, about 10 minutes. Remove the saucepan from heat, add the grated cheeses, salt, chili powder, and garlic powder, and stir until combined. Set aside.  
3. Cook macaroni according to the package instructions. Once cooked, strain the macaroni and toss it with the prepared cheese sauce. Serve immediately.
