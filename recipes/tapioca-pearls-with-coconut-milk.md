## Instructions

1. **Cook Tapioca Pearls:**  
   Rinse tapioca pearls under cold water. Bring 2 cups of water to a boil. Add tapioca and cook for 10–15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until translucent. Drain and rinse with cold water.

2. **Make Coconut Milk Base:**  
   In a saucepan, combine coconut milk, sugar, and salt. Heat over medium heat until sugar dissolves (do not boil). Add vanilla extract if using.

3. **Combine:**  
   Add cooked tapioca pearls to the coconut milk. Simmer gently for 2–3 minutes to blend flavors.

4. **Serve:**  
   Spoon into bowls and serve warm or chilled. Garnish with fresh fruit or a drizzle of extra coconut milk if desired.

## Notes
- For added aroma, try adding a pandan leaf or a few drops of pandan extract.
- Best enjoyed the day it’s made; tapioca pearls can harden when stored too long.
