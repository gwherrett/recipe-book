## Directions
1. Reconstitute the dried porcini mushrooms in boiling water for 20 minutes until tender. Drain and coarsely chop.
2. Puree the mushrooms, pancetta, onion, celery, carrots, and garlic together in a blender.
3. In a heavy-bottomed pot, heat the olive oil with the bay leaves and rosemary until fragrant. Add the vegetable-pancetta puree and cook 5–10 minutes.
4. Increase the heat and add the ground pork and beef. Cook until no longer pink, breaking up clumps with a wooden spoon.
5. Add the milk and simmer until nearly evaporated, about 10 minutes.
6. Add crushed tomatoes and red wine. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, cover, and simmer gently for 1 1/2 to 2 hours until thick.
7. Taste and adjust seasoning.
8. Cook tagliatelle in salted boiling water until al dente, 8–10 minutes. Drain well and toss with the Bolognese sauce.
9. Serve topped with ricotta, shredded basil, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and a drizzle of olive oil.

## Notes
- For a richer sauce, uncover during the last 30 minutes of simmering to reduce further.
- Sauce improves even more the next day.
