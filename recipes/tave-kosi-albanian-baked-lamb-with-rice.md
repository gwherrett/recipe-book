## Ingredients

### Base:

- ½ cup short-grain or medium-grain rice (e.g. Arborio or Calrose)  
- 1½ cups lamb broth (hot)  
- Salt and pepper to taste

### Yogurt Custard Topping:

## Instructions

1. **Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).**  
   Grease a medium baking dish (around 8x11").

2. **Par-cook the rice in broth:**  
   In a saucepan, melt 1 tbsp butter or oil and briefly sauté the minced garlic (if using).  
   Stir in the rice and toast for 1 minute.  
   Add **1½ cups hot lamb broth**, a pinch of salt, and bring to a gentle simmer.  
   **Simmer uncovered for 8–10 minutes** until rice is partially cooked and liquid is mostly absorbed (it will finish baking in the oven).

3. **Prepare the yogurt topping:**  
   In a mixing bowl, whisk together yogurt, eggs, flour, melted butter, salt, and nutmeg or oregano (if using) until smooth.

4. **Assemble the dish:**  
   - Spread cooked lamb evenly in the baking dish.  
   - Spoon the par-cooked rice (with any remaining broth) over and around the lamb.  
   - Pour the yogurt mixture evenly over the top.

5. **Bake uncovered for 40–50 minutes**, or until the custard is set and golden on top.

6. **Let rest 10–15 minutes** before serving.
