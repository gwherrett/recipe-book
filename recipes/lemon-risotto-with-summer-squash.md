## Ingredients
- 6 cups chicken or vegetable stock
- 2 tbsp olive oil or butter
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1½ cups arborio rice
- ½ cup dry white wine
- 2 small zucchini or yellow summer squash (about ¾ lb / 340 g total), diced
- 1 lemon (zest and juice)
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving
- 2 tbsp unsalted butter (optional, for richness)
- Salt and black pepper, to taste
- Handful fresh basil, mint, or parsley, chopped (for garnish)

## Method
1. **Warm the stock:** Bring stock to a bare simmer in a saucepan; keep warm over low heat.
2. **Sauté aromatics:** In a wide pan, heat oil/butter over medium. Add onion and cook until translucent, 4–5 minutes. Stir in garlic; cook 30 seconds.
3. **Toast rice:** Add arborio; stir until grains are glossy and the edges turn translucent, about 2 minutes.
4. **Deglaze:** Add wine; stir until fully absorbed.
5. **Cook risotto:** Add about ½ cup hot stock at a time, stirring frequently and letting each addition absorb before the next. Continue 18–22 minutes until rice is al dente and creamy.
6. **Add squash:** Stir in diced squash halfway through cooking so it softens yet holds its shape.
7. **Finish:** Off heat, stir in lemon zest and juice, Parmesan, and butter (if using). Season with salt and pepper.
8. **Serve:** Top with herbs and extra Parmesan. Serve immediately.

## Notes & Variations
- **Vegan:** Use olive oil and swap Parmesan for a vegan hard cheese or 2–3 tbsp nutritional yeast.
- **Add-ins:** Peas, asparagus tips, or a pinch of red pepper flakes work nicely.
- **Grain swaps:** Farro or pearled barley give a heartier chew (increase liquid and time).
- **Make it brighter:** Reserve a little zest to sprinkle just before serving.
