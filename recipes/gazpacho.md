# Gazpacho

**Category:** Soups & Chilled Dishes  
**Tags:** Spanish, vegetarian, summer, no-cook

**Summary:** A classic Andalusian cold tomato soup—refreshing, bright, and perfect for hot days. This version blends ripe tomatoes with cucumber, bell pepper, onion, garlic, olive oil, and a splash of red wine vinegar. Serve very cold with crunchy toppings.

**Serves:** 4–6  
**Time:** 20 minutes active, plus 2 hours chilling

## Ingredients
- 6 ripe tomatoes, chopped
- 1 cucumber, peeled and chopped
- 1 bell pepper (green or red), chopped
- 1 small red onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 3 cups tomato juice (or half tomato juice, half water)
- 1/4 cup red wine vinegar
- 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- *Optional body:* 1–2 slices stale bread, soaked and squeezed dry
- *Optional garnishes:* chopped hard‑boiled egg, diced ham, croutons, minced herbs (parsley/chives), diced cucumber & pepper

## Method
1. **Blend the base:** Combine tomatoes, cucumber, bell pepper, onion, and garlic in a blender or food processor. Blend until smooth (or leave a little texture if you prefer it chunky).
2. **Add bread (optional):** If using, add the soaked bread and blend until fully incorporated and smooth.
3. **Emulsify:** With the blender running, stream in the olive oil to emulsify.
4. **Season & balance:** Transfer to a bowl. Stir in the tomato juice and red wine vinegar. Season generously with salt and pepper. Adjust acidity (more vinegar) and body (more oil or juice) to taste.
5. **Chill thoroughly:** Cover and refrigerate at least **2 hours** (or overnight) so the flavors meld and the soup gets very cold.
6. **Serve:** Ladle into chilled bowls and finish with your choice of garnishes.

## Notes
- **Tomatoes:** Peak‑season, very ripe tomatoes make the best gazpacho. Out of season, add a pinch of sugar to balance acidity.
- **Texture:** For ultra‑smooth, pass through a fine mesh sieve. For rustic style, pulse only.
- **Make‑ahead:** Keeps 2–3 days refrigerated. Stir before serving.
- **Variations:** Add a small piece of jalapeño for heat; swap red wine vinegar for sherry vinegar (traditional); or blend in a few ice cubes right before serving for extra chill.
