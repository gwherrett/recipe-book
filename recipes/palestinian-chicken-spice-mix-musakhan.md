# Palestinian Roast Chicken Spice Mix (Musakhan-Style)

**Category:** Pickles & Condiments → Spice Blends  
**Tags:** Palestinian, Musakhan, spice blend, roast chicken  
**Yield:** ~5 tbsp (enough for 1 whole chicken or 1.2–1.5 kg chicken pieces)  
**Active time:** 5 minutes

## Summary
A fragrant, tangy-warm spice mix inspired by Palestinian musakhan. Classic notes of **sumac** and **allspice** lead, rounded by cinnamon, cumin, coriander, and cardamom. Use as a dry rub or bloom in olive oil to brush on chicken before roasting.

## Ingredients
- 1 tbsp ground allspice (pimento)
- 1 tbsp ground sumac
- 1/2 tbsp ground cinnamon
- 1/2 tbsp ground cumin
- 1/2 tbsp ground coriander
- 1/2 tsp ground cardamom
- 1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper
- 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
- 1/4 tsp ground cloves
- 1–1 1/2 tsp fine salt, or to taste

> **Salt guidance:** Start with 3/4–1 tsp salt per 500 g chicken when using this as a full rub. Adjust to taste and dietary needs.

## Method
1. **Mix:** Combine all spices and salt in a small bowl until uniform.  
2. **Use as a rub:** Pat chicken dry. Rub 2–3 tbsp of the mix all over (and under the skin if you like). Rest 30 minutes at room temp or refrigerate 4–24 hours.  
3. **Olive-oil brush (optional):** Stir 2–3 tbsp spice mix with 3–4 tbsp olive oil; brush onto chicken for deeper color and flavor.  
4. **Roast:** Roast at **190°C / 375°F** until done (internal temp 74°C / 165°F), typically 45–60 min for pieces or 60–90 min for a whole bird depending on size.

## Notes & Variations
- **Onions & sumac (Musakhan vibe):** Slow-sauté 2–3 large onions in olive oil with 1–2 tsp sumac and a pinch of the spice mix; spoon over the chicken or serve with flatbread.  
- **Toasted version:** Lightly toast the cumin and coriander seeds whole, then grind for a fresher, nuttier profile.  
- **Heat option:** Add a pinch of Aleppo or chili flakes if you prefer gentle heat (not traditional, but tasty).  
- **Storage:** Airtight jar, cool and dark, up to 3 months for best aromatics.

## Scaling
- **Whole chicken (1.5–2.0 kg):** Use 3–4 tbsp spice mix + 1–2 tsp additional salt as needed.  
- **Bone-in thighs (1.2 kg):** Use ~3 tbsp spice mix.  
- **Breasts (800 g):** Use ~2 tbsp spice mix.
