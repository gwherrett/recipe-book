## Instructions

1. **Preheat oven** to 400°F (200°C).

2. **Cook filling:**  
   Heat oil or butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion, carrots, and celery. Cook 5–6 minutes until softened.  
   Stir in corn and cook 1–2 more minutes. Sprinkle in flour and stir constantly for 1–2 minutes.  
   Slowly add broth and milk, stirring to avoid lumps. Simmer until thickened (5–6 minutes).  
   Add chicken, thyme, salt, and pepper. Remove from heat.

3. **Fill ramekins:**  
   Divide the mixture evenly among 4–6 ramekins.

4. **Top with crust:**  
   Cut puff pastry or pie crust to fit just over each ramekin (with a little overhang). Press edges down and cut a small slit in the top for steam.

5. **Egg wash:**  
   Brush tops with beaten egg.

6. **Bake:**  
   Place ramekins on a baking sheet to catch drips. Bake for 25–30 minutes or until golden brown and bubbly.

7. **Cool:**  
   Let sit for 5–10 minutes before serving.
