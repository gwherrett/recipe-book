### 👩‍🍳 Preparation

1. **Prepare the broth:**  
   Heat the seafood broth in a large pot and stir in saffron.  

2. **Season seafood:**  
   Pat fish and shrimp dry with paper towels. Sprinkle lightly with sea salt and let sit 10 minutes.  

3. **Make the seasoning paste:**  
   Using a mortar and pestle, mash parsley, garlic, thyme, and ⅛ tsp salt into a paste. Stir in paprika, adding a splash of water if needed.  

4. **Cook the fish:**  
   Heat **6 tbsp olive oil** in a 15-inch paella pan over medium-high heat. Quickly brown the fish (1–2 minutes) without fully cooking. Remove and set aside.  

5. **Sauté aromatics:**  
   Add remaining **2 tbsp olive oil**, onion, scallions, and bell pepper. Cook until softened.  
   Increase heat, add tomato, and cook 2–5 minutes until it becomes sauce-like.  

6. **Add broth and rice:**  
   Pour in hot broth and bring to a boil. Sprinkle rice evenly across the pan. Boil for 3 minutes, stirring and rotating the pan occasionally.  

7. **Combine and simmer:**  
   Add reserved fish (but not shrimp) and stir in parsley paste. Taste for salt.  
   Lower heat and simmer without stirring until rice is no longer soupy but still has liquid to finish cooking (about 10 min). Add extra liquid if needed.  

8. **Add shellfish:**  
   Arrange shrimp, clams, and mussels over the rice, placing shell edges up so they open during cooking.  
   Cook uncovered for 15–20 minutes until rice is nearly done.  

9. **Rest and serve:**  
   Remove from heat, cover with foil, and let sit for 10 minutes.  
   Garnish with lemon wedges and serve with fresh alioli.

### 🍋 Notes
- Traditional paella should form a light crust (the **socarrat**) on the bottom — avoid stirring once the rice starts simmering.  
- Use high-quality saffron and good seafood broth for authentic flavor.  
- Pairs beautifully with Albariño or Verdejo wine.
