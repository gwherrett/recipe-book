# Mango Syrup

**Category:** Pickles & Condiments → Syrups  
**Tags:** mango, syrup, cocktails, pancakes, soda, desserts

**Summary:** A bright, tropical syrup made from ripe mangoes. Perfect for cocktails, Italian sodas, pancakes/waffles, yogurt, and desserts.

## Ingredients
- 2 cups mango purée (from ~2 ripe mangoes)
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1 cup water
- 1–2 tbsp lemon juice (optional, for brightness)
- 1/4 tsp fine salt (optional, to balance sweetness)

## Method
1. **Prep & purée:** Peel mangoes, remove pits, and cube. Blend until completely smooth; measure **2 cups** purée.
2. **Simmer:** In a medium saucepan, whisk together mango purée, sugar, and water. Add lemon juice and salt if using. Bring to a gentle boil over medium heat, then reduce to a simmer. Cook **20–30 minutes**, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened and glossy.
3. **Finish:** Cool to room temperature. For an ultra‑smooth syrup, pass through a fine‑mesh strainer.
4. **Store:** Funnel into a clean bottle or jar. Refrigerate up to **2 weeks**. For longer storage, freeze in small portions (ice‑cube tray, then bag).

## Notes
- **Ratio for scaling:** 2 : 1 : 1 (mango purée : sugar : water, by volume).
- **Yield:** About 2 to 2½ cups, depending on reduction.
- **Uses:** Mango lemonade (1–2 tbsp per glass), sparkling soda (1 oz syrup + ice + sparkling water), margaritas/daquiris, cheesecake drizzle, or over pancakes/waffles.
- **Variations:** Add a small piece of crushed ginger during simmer; or a pinch of cardamom for a warm, floral note.
