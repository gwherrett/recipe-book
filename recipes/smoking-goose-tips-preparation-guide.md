# Smoking Goose: Tips & Preparation Guide

## Should the Goose Be Butchered?
It’s best to **keep the goose whole** when smoking. A whole goose cooks more evenly and retains moisture better than smaller pieces. However, if time or presentation demands it, you can break it down—just be cautious of overcooking and drying out the meat.

## Smoking Tips

### 1. Brine the Goose
- Brining helps retain moisture and adds flavor.
- Use a basic saltwater brine or enhance it with garlic, bay leaves, herbs, and spices.
- Brine for **12–24 hours** in the refrigerator.

### 2. Score the Skin
- Goose is very fatty—score the skin in a crosshatch pattern to help the fat render.
- Don’t cut into the meat, just through the skin and top layer of fat.

### 3. Low and Slow Cooking
- Smoke at **225°F (107°C)** for several hours.
- Target internal temps: **165°F in the breast**, **175°F in the thighs**.

### 4. Wood Selection
- Best woods: **apple**, **cherry**, or **hickory**.
- These provide a sweet and smoky flavor that complements goose well.

### 5. Rest Before Carving
- Let the smoked goose rest for **15–20 minutes** before slicing.
- This redistributes the juices and keeps the meat tender.

## Optional: Butchering Before Smoking
If you do choose to break the goose into parts:
- Separate legs/thighs from the breast to account for different cook times.
- Consider confit for the legs and smoking only the breast.

## Serving Suggestions
- Serve with spiced fruit compote, roasted vegetables, or a tangy red cabbage slaw.
