## Method

1. **Preheat oven** to 375°F / 150°C.

2. **Make the truffle butter:**  
   Shave half of the truffle into thin slices, then finely dice.  
   In a small bowl, combine with softened butter. Season with lemon juice, sea salt, and white pepper. Set aside.

3. **Prepare the mushroom base:**  
   Heat olive oil in a small saucepan over medium‑high heat.  
   Add chanterelles and garlic; sauté until softened. Season to taste.  
   Transfer mixture to a heatproof casserole dish. Add chicken stock and bring to a boil.  
   Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 2–3 minutes. Remove from heat.

4. **Sear the sablefish:**  
   Season each piece with salt and pepper.  
   Heat oil in a skillet over high heat.  
   Sear sablefish skin‑side down until skin is crisp, about 1 minute.  
   Transfer fish to the casserole with mushroom broth.

5. **Braise:**  
   Place casserole in the oven and bake 4–5 minutes.  
   Remove, uncover, and set over low heat.  
   Adjust seasoning. Add **2 Tbsp truffle butter**, allowing it to emulsify into the broth.

6. **Finish the dish:**  
   Add warmed asparagus and pearl onions to the casserole.  
   Shave remaining black truffle over the sablefish.  

7. **Serve:**  
   Divide contents of the casserole onto four warmed plates and serve immediately.
