## Notes

- Passing the custard through a sift ensures a smooth, silky texture
- Only fill tarts 90% full to prevent overflow during baking
- Covering with foil prevents over-browning on top
- The custard should be set but still slightly jiggly in the center
- Best served warm, but can also be enjoyed at room temperature
- Traditional Hong Kong-style egg tarts use puff pastry; Portuguese-style uses a cookie crust
- Metal tart shells help conduct heat and create flakier pastry
- Can be reheated in a 350°F oven for 5 minutes
