# Garlic Mashed Potatoes with Yogurt

**Category:** Sides  
**Serves:** 4–6  
**Time:** 30 minutes

A lighter, tangy twist on classic mashed potatoes using plain Greek yogurt for creaminess.

## Ingredients
- 2 lb potatoes (Yukon Gold or russet), peeled and cut into chunks  
- 4–6 cloves garlic, peeled  
- 1 cup plain Greek yogurt (adjust to taste)  
- 3 tbsp unsalted butter  
- 1–1½ tsp kosher salt, plus more to taste  
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste  
- Optional: chopped chives or parsley for garnish

## Instructions
1. **Boil:** Add potatoes and garlic to a pot, cover with cold water, season with 1 tbsp salt. Bring to a boil, then simmer until fork‑tender, 15–20 minutes.
2. **Drain & Dry:** Drain well and return potatoes/garlic to the hot pot. Let steam‑dry 1–2 minutes.
3. **Mash:** Mash the potatoes and garlic until smooth and fluffy.
4. **Enrich:** Add butter and stir to melt. Fold in the yogurt until creamy. If too thick, loosen with a splash of warm milk or a bit more yogurt.
5. **Season:** Taste and season with additional salt and pepper.
6. **Finish:** Transfer to a warm bowl and garnish with chives or parsley.

## Tips
- **Extra‑garlicky?** Gently sauté minced garlic in 1 tbsp butter until just golden and stir in.  
- **Ultra‑smooth:** Use a ricer/food mill instead of a masher.  
- **Make‑ahead:** Reheat gently with a splash of milk to restore creaminess.

## Variations
- **Herby:** Fold in 2 tbsp minced chives, dill, or parsley.  
- **Olive oil:** Swap butter for good olive oil to make it lighter and dairy‑flexible.  
- **Roasted garlic:** Replace raw cloves with 1 head of roasted garlic for sweetness.
