# Horseradish Corn Cheese Melt

**Category:** Sandwiches & Melts  
**Tags:** quick, vegetarian, weeknight, cheesy, corn, horseradish  
**Time:** 15–20 minutes  
**Serves:** 4

## Ingredients
- 8 slices bread (sourdough, rye, or country white)
- 2 cups (200 g) shredded sharp cheddar (or 50/50 cheddar–mozzarella)
- 1 cup corn kernels (canned, drained; or frozen, thawed and patted dry)
- 2 tbsp prepared horseradish (more to taste)
- 2 tbsp mayonnaise (or sour cream/Greek yogurt)
- 1 tsp Dijon mustard (optional)
- 1 small scallion, finely sliced (optional)
- 1/4 tsp black pepper
- Pinch of salt (to taste)
- 2–3 tbsp softened butter (or mayo) for the bread

## Method
1. **Heat oven/broiler:** Preheat to 425°F (220°C) or set broiler to high. Line a sheet pan with parchment.
2. **Mix filling:** In a bowl, combine cheese, corn, horseradish, mayonnaise, Dijon (if using), scallion, pepper, and a pinch of salt.
3. **Assemble:** Lightly butter one side of each bread slice. Place 4 slices buttered-side down on the sheet. Divide the filling evenly over them. Top with the remaining slices, buttered-side up.
4. **Melt:** Bake 8–10 minutes (or broil 3–5 minutes, watching closely), until bread is golden and cheese is melty. Flip once halfway for extra even browning if baking.
5. **Serve:** Rest 1–2 minutes, then slice. Great with a simple green salad or tomato soup.

## Notes & Variations
- **Extra punch:** Add 1–2 tsp horseradish to taste or a splash of Worcestershire.
- **Add-ins:** Sliced tomato, pickled jalapeños, crispy bacon, or thin ham/turkey.
- **Open-face option:** Skip the top slice and broil as tartines.
- **Pan method:** Griddle over medium in a skillet 3–4 minutes per side, pressing gently.
