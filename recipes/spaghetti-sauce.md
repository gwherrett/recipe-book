# Modern Red Sauce Spaghetti with Pork & Beef (1 kg Batch)

**Category:** Pasta & Noodles  
**Tags:** modern, red sauce, pork and beef, family meal  
**Time:** ~1 hour  
**Serves:** 8–10  

## Ingredients
- 1 kg (2.2 lb) ground meat — ½ pork + ½ beef  
- 2 tbsp olive oil  
- 2 medium red onions, finely chopped  
- 4 celery stalks, finely chopped  
- 4 medium carrots, peeled & finely chopped  
- 6–8 cloves garlic, minced  
- 4 tbsp tomato paste  
- 2 cans (28 oz / 796 ml each) crushed tomatoes (preferably San Marzano)  
- 2 tsp dried oregano  
- 1 tsp dried thyme  
- 1 tsp smoked paprika  
- 1 tsp red pepper flakes (adjust to taste)  
- ½ cup dry red wine (optional)  
- Kosher salt & black pepper, to taste  
- 450–500 g (1 lb) spaghetti or linguine  
- To finish: chopped fresh basil & parsley, grated Pecorino Romano  

## Method
1. **Cook pasta.** Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti until *al dente*. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water; drain and set aside.  
2. **Brown the meat.** In a large Dutch oven or wide sauté pan, heat olive oil over medium-high. Add pork and beef, season with salt and pepper, and cook until browned and slightly crispy, 10–12 min. Transfer to a plate, leaving the drippings.  
3. **Build the base.** Add chopped onion, celery, and carrots to the pot. Sauté over medium heat until softened and lightly caramelized, 10 min. Add garlic; cook 30 sec until fragrant.  
4. **Caramelize tomato paste.** Push vegetables aside; add tomato paste to the open spot. Cook 2 min, stirring, until deep red and fragrant.  
5. **Deglaze & combine.** Add red wine (if using) and scrape up the fond from the bottom. Stir in crushed tomatoes, oregano, thyme, smoked paprika, and red pepper flakes. Return browned meat (and juices) to the pot.  
6. **Simmer.** Lower heat and simmer 25–30 min, stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens and flavors meld. Add splashes of pasta water if it gets too thick.  
7. **Season & finish.** Taste and adjust seasoning. Toss in the cooked spaghetti and stir to coat. Let it rest 1–2 min to absorb sauce.  
8. **Serve.** Top with chopped basil, parsley, and a generous snowfall of Pecorino Romano.  

## Notes
- **Deeper flavor:** Add 1 tsp fish sauce or 1 anchovy fillet with the tomato paste.  
- **Umami boost:** Stir in 1 tbsp butter before serving.  
- **Storage:** Keeps 4–5 days refrigerated or 3 months frozen.
