# Christmas Morning Wifesaver

**Source:** The Best of the Best - Vol. 1 (Page 26), also in Enjoy! (Page 33)

Superb! A classic make-ahead breakfast casserole perfect for holiday mornings. Assemble the night before and pop in the oven in the morning while opening presents. The savory egg-soaked bread layered with bacon and cheese creates a dish similar to a savory bread pudding.

## Notes

- The overnight soak is essential - it allows the bread to absorb the custard
- Use a glass baking dish as specified for even cooking
- Canadian back bacon is leaner than regular bacon; ham works well too
- The cereal topping adds a delightful crunch
- Perfect for Christmas morning, Easter brunch, or any special occasion
- Can be assembled up to 24 hours in advance
