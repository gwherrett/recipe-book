- 2 cloves garlic, minced

- 1 can (28 oz / 796 mL) crushed tomatoes
- 1 tsp ground cumin

## Method

1. **Mix the meatballs.** In a bowl, combine lamb, breadcrumbs, egg, garlic, cumin, paprika, salt, pepper, parsley, and (if using) milk/water. Mix just until combined—avoid over‑working. Roll into 18–22 meatballs (about 1–1 1/4 inches / 3 cm). Chill 10 minutes while you start the sauce.
2. **Start the sauce.** Heat olive oil in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat. Sauté onion, carrots, and green pepper with a pinch of salt until softened and lightly golden, 6–8 minutes. Add garlic and cook 30–60 seconds until fragrant.
3. **Build and simmer.** Stir in crushed tomatoes, cumin, paprika, salt, pepper, and water/broth. Bring to a gentle simmer. Taste; add a small pinch of sugar or a splash of red wine vinegar if the tomatoes are very sharp.
4. **Cook the meatballs in the sauce.** Nestle the meatballs into the simmering sauce in a single layer. Cover and cook at a gentle simmer for 20–25 minutes, turning once halfway, until the meatballs are cooked through (internal temp ~160°F / 71°C) and the sauce has thickened.
5. **Finish & serve.** Adjust seasoning. Garnish with chopped parsley or cilantro. Serve with couscous, rice, pasta, or crusty bread.

## Notes & Variations
- **Spice profile:** Add 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon or coriander for a Moroccan‑leaning vibe; a pinch of chili flakes for heat.
- **Make‑ahead:** Meatballs can be rolled and chilled up to 24 hours or frozen raw for 2 months. Cook from thawed or add 5–7 minutes if partially frozen.
- **Browning option:** For deeper flavor, brown meatballs in 1 tbsp oil before simmering; deglaze the pan with a splash of broth and proceed with the sauce.
- **Veg swaps:** Yellow pepper or zucchini work well in place of green pepper; add a handful of peas in the last 5 minutes for sweetness.
- **Serving ideas:** Great over buttered couscous with lemon zest, or with al dente spaghetti and grated pecorino.

## Storage
Refrigerate in an airtight container up to 4 days. Freeze up to 3 months. Reheat gently on the stovetop with a splash of water.
