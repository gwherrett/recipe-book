## Notes

- The apple adds sweetness and crunch - use a crisp variety like Granny Smith or Honeycrisp
- Can be made a few hours ahead, but best served within 4-6 hours to maintain crispness
- The dried cranberries provide a nice sweet-tart contrast
- Great for potlucks and BBQs
- Can substitute sweetened dried cranberries (Craisins) and reduce sugar in dressing
- Add chopped walnuts or pecans for extra crunch and nutrition
