# Aloo Gobi (Potato & Cauliflower Curry)

## Ingredients:
- **2 medium potatoes** (peeled and cubed)
- **1 medium cauliflower** (cut into florets)
- **1 medium onion** (finely chopped)
- **2 medium tomatoes** (chopped or pureed)
- **2-3 cloves of garlic** (minced)
- **1-inch piece of ginger** (grated)
- **2-3 green chilies** (slit, optional for spice)
- **2-3 tbsp cooking oil**
- **1 tsp cumin seeds**
- **1/2 tsp turmeric powder**
- **1 tsp ground coriander**
- **1 tsp ground cumin**
- **1/2 tsp red chili powder** (adjust to taste)
- **1 tsp garam masala**
- **Salt** (to taste)
- **Fresh cilantro leaves** (chopped, for garnish)

## Instructions:
1. **Heat the Oil:**  
   In a large pan or wok, heat oil on medium heat. Add cumin seeds and let them splutter.

2. **Sauté Aromatics:**  
   Add chopped onions and sauté until golden brown. Stir in garlic, ginger, and green chilies. Cook for another minute.

3. **Cook the Tomatoes:**  
   Add the chopped or pureed tomatoes. Cook until the mixture thickens and the oil begins to separate.

4. **Add Spices:**  
   Add turmeric, ground coriander, ground cumin, and red chili powder. Mix well.

5. **Cook the Potatoes:**  
   Add the potato cubes. Stir to coat them in the spice mixture. Cover and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.

6. **Add the Cauliflower:**  
   Add the cauliflower florets and mix well. Add a splash of water (2-3 tablespoons) to prevent sticking. Cover and cook on low-medium heat for 15-20 minutes or until the potatoes and cauliflower are tender. Stir occasionally.

7. **Finish with Garam Masala:**  
   Sprinkle garam masala and mix gently. Adjust salt to taste.

8. **Garnish:**  
   Garnish with fresh cilantro leaves before serving.

## Serving Suggestion:
Serve hot with **naan**, **roti**, or steamed **basmati rice**. A side of yogurt or raita complements the flavors well.
