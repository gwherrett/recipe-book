# Spaghetti alle Vongole (in Bianco)

**Category:** Pasta & Seafood  
**Tags:** Italian, Classic, Seafood, Quick Dinner  
**Summary:** A traditional Italian pasta dish featuring tender clams, garlic, white wine, and parsley — simple, elegant, and full of briny flavor.

## Ingredients
- 200 g spaghetti  
- 2 cloves garlic, finely sliced  
- 1 small dried chili (optional), finely sliced  
- 500 g small clams, cleaned  
- 1 small bunch flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped (stalks and leaves separated)  
- 3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil  
- 200 ml dry white wine  
- Salt, to taste  

## Method
1. **Prepare the clams:** Rinse under cold running water and scrub if necessary. Discard any clams that remain open when tapped or have broken shells.  
2. **Cook the pasta:** Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the spaghetti until al dente. Reserve a small cup of pasta water.  
3. **Sauté aromatics:** In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the garlic, parsley stalks, and chili (if using). Sauté for 1–2 minutes until lightly golden and fragrant.  
4. **Cook the clams:** Add the cleaned clams and pour in the wine. Cover and simmer for 3–4 minutes, shaking the pan occasionally, until the clams open. Discard any that stay closed.  
5. **Combine pasta and sauce:** Drain the spaghetti and add it directly to the pan with the clams. Toss well with a drizzle of olive oil, most of the chopped parsley leaves, and a splash of pasta water if needed to loosen the sauce.  
6. **Season and serve:** Taste and season with salt as needed. Garnish with the remaining parsley and an extra drizzle of olive oil. Serve immediately.

**Yield:** Serves 2  
**Active Time:** 20 minutes
