## 🔥 Instructions

### 1. Simmer the pork:
In a large pot, add pork shoulder, bones (if using), onion, garlic, salt, and water. Bring to a boil, skim off foam, then reduce to a simmer. Cook for 1.5 to 2 hours until the pork is tender and shreds easily. Remove onion and garlic.

### 2. Make the red chile sauce:
While the pork simmers, remove stems and seeds from guajillo and ancho chiles. Toast lightly on a hot skillet (30 sec per side), then soak in hot water for 20 minutes. Blend soaked chiles with garlic, oregano, and 1 cup of broth until smooth. Strain through a sieve.

### 3. Add sauce and hominy:
Add the red chile sauce and drained hominy to the pot. Stir and simmer uncovered for 30–45 minutes to meld flavors. Taste and adjust salt.

### 4. Serve and garnish:
Ladle pozole into bowls. Garnish with cabbage, radish, onion, lime, and toppings of choice.

## 📝 Notes
- **Dried hominy:** Soak overnight and simmer separately ~2 hours before adding.
- **Chicken version:** Use bone-in chicken thighs, reduce simmering time.
- **Make-ahead:** Even better the next day!
