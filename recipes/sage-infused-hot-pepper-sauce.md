# Sage-Infused Hot Pepper Sauce

**Category:** Condiments & Sauces  
**Cuisine:** Italian-inspired fusion  

## Summary
A deep, herbal chili oil that balances the heat of red peppers with the earthy flavor of sage. Ideal for roasted meats, grilled vegetables, or pasta.

## Ingredients
- 6–8 fresh red chilies (or 2 tbsp chili flakes)  
- 6 fresh sage leaves  
- 2 cloves garlic, lightly crushed  
- 1 cup olive oil (or half olive oil, half neutral oil)  
- Pinch of salt  

## Method
1. Warm the oil gently — do not let it smoke.  
2. Add garlic and sage, and infuse until fragrant (1–2 minutes).  
3. Add chilies and cook on low heat for 3–5 minutes.  
4. Remove from heat, let cool, and strain (optional).  
5. Store in a clean jar; use within 2 weeks refrigerated.

## Notes
- Try smoked chilies for extra depth.  
- Works well drizzled over pasta, grilled vegetables, or roasted meats.
