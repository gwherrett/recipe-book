# Dill Sour Cream Sauce for Pierogies

## Ingredients
- 1 cup sour cream  
- 2 tablespoons fresh dill, finely chopped (or 1 tablespoon dried dill)  
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice or white vinegar  
- 1 clove garlic, minced (optional)  
- ½ teaspoon salt (adjust to taste)  
- ¼ teaspoon black pepper  
- 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard (optional, for extra tang)  
- 1–2 tablespoons milk or water (to thin, if needed)  

## Instructions
1. In a small bowl, mix together the sour cream, dill, lemon juice (or vinegar), garlic, salt, and pepper.  
2. If using Dijon mustard, add it in and mix well.  
3. Adjust consistency by stirring in 1–2 tablespoons of milk or water if a thinner sauce is preferred.  
4. Let the sauce sit for at least 10 minutes to allow flavors to meld.  
5. Serve with warm pierogies and enjoy!  

## Notes
- This sauce pairs beautifully with potato and cheese pierogies, but also complements mushroom or meat-filled varieties.
