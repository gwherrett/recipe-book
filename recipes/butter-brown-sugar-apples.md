## Ingredients

- 3–4 medium apples (Granny Smith, Honeycrisp, or Golden Delicious), peeled, cored, and sliced
- 4 tbsp unsalted butter  
- ½ cup brown sugar (light or dark)  
- ½ tsp ground cinnamon (optional)

- 1 tsp vanilla extract (optional)  
- Juice from ½ lemon (optional, to prevent browning)

## Method

1. **Prep the Apples:**  
   Toss apple slices with lemon juice if desired to prevent browning.

2. **Melt Butter:**  
   In a large skillet, melt butter over medium heat until foamy.

3. **Add Apples:**  
   Add sliced apples and cook for 3–4 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they begin to soften.

4. **Add Sugar and Spices:**  
   Sprinkle brown sugar, cinnamon, and a pinch of salt over the apples. Stir to coat evenly.

5. **Simmer:**  
   Lower heat and simmer 5–7 minutes until apples are tender and sauce thickens slightly.

6. **Finish and Serve:**  
   Stir in vanilla extract (if using). Serve warm on their own or with vanilla ice cream, yogurt, or pancakes.

**Notes:**  
- For extra flavor, add a splash of bourbon or maple syrup while simmering.  
- Use firm apples for best texture; softer varieties may break down too quickly.
