## Summary
A bright, no‑cook tomato salsa with onion, cilantro, jalapeño, and lime. Perfect with tortilla chips, tacos, grilled meats, or scrambled eggs.

## Ingredients
- 4 medium ripe tomatoes, finely diced (Roma preferred)
- 1/2 medium white or red onion, finely chopped
- 1 jalapeño, finely chopped (seeded for less heat)
- 1/2 cup fresh cilantro, finely chopped
- Juice of 1 lime (2–3 tbsp)
- 1/2 tsp kosher salt, plus more to taste
- Optional: 1 small clove garlic, microplaned; pinch of sugar if tomatoes are very acidic

## Method
1. Combine tomatoes, onion, jalapeño, and cilantro in a bowl.
2. Add lime juice and salt; toss to coat.
3. Taste and adjust: more salt for pop, more lime for brightness, more jalapeño for heat.
4. Let rest 15–30 minutes to meld, then serve.

## Notes & Variations
- **Tomatoes:** Use firm, ripe tomatoes. If very juicy, core and squeeze out seeds to reduce wateriness.
- **Add‑ins:** Diced avocado (serve immediately), mango or pineapple for sweetness, or a splash of orange juice.
- **Make‑ahead:** Best the day it’s made; keeps 1–2 days refrigerated. Stir and re‑season before serving.
- **Texture tip:** For a less watery salsa, dice tomatoes small and drain excess liquid before mixing.

## Serving Ideas
- Spoon over carne asada, fish tacos, or breakfast burritos.
- Mix with diced cucumber for a crunchy pico variation.
- Pair with guacamole and chips for a classic duo.
