# Pita Crisp–Crusted Chicken (Classic Herb Mix)

A light, ultra-crispy chicken cutlet made with finely crushed pita crisps and a classic Southern-style herb blend inspired by the 11 herbs & spices tradition—white pepper forward, warm, aromatic, and perfectly suited to air frying.

- ½ cup buttermilk **or** 1 beaten egg mixed with 2 tbsp water
- 1 tsp hot sauce (optional)

### Classic Herb Seasoning Mix
*(for 2 cups crushed pita crisps)*  
- 1 tbsp all-purpose flour  
- 1 tsp white pepper  
- ½ tsp black pepper  
- 1 tsp paprika (sweet)  
- 1 tsp garlic powder  
- ½ tsp celery seed, lightly crushed

- ½ tsp dried basil  
- ¼–½ tsp dried sage

## Instructions

### 1. Prepare the Chicken  
- Slice chicken breasts horizontally into cutlets (½–¾ inch thickness).  
- Combine buttermilk (or egg wash) with hot sauce in a shallow dish.  
- Add chicken and rotate to coat evenly.

### 2. Make the Pita Crisp Crust  
- Crush pita crisps to a fine, panko-dust consistency.  
- In a separate bowl, mix crisps with the full **Classic Herb Seasoning Mix**.

### 3. Crust the Chicken  
- Let excess marinade drip off.  
- Press each cutlet firmly into the seasoned pita crisp mixture.  
- Shake off excess to maintain a thin, even crust.

### 4. Air Fry  
- Preheat air fryer to **375°F (190°C)**.  
- Lightly spray basket with oil.  
- Arrange cutlets in a single layer.  
- Mist the tops lightly with oil spray.  
- Cook **8–10 minutes per side** (for cutlets) or **14–18 minutes** (for full breasts).  
- Internal temperature should reach **165°F (74°C)**.

### 5. Rest  
- Let rest 3 minutes to set the crust and retain juiciness.

## Tips
- For a stronger white-pepper finish, add +¼ tsp white pepper.  
- If pita crisps are heavily seasoned, reduce added salt.  
- Add 1 tbsp grated Parmesan to deepen savouriness without adding oil.  
- Works exceptionally well with turkey cutlets or thin pork chops.
