# Japanese Spinach Salad with Sesame Dressing (Gomaae)

A classic Japanese side dish: blanched spinach tossed in a nutty, sweet-savory sesame dressing. Served chilled or at room temperature.

## Ingredients

### For the Sauce
- 3 Tbsp tahini  
- 1 Tbsp soy sauce  
- 1 Tbsp sugar  

### For the Spinach
- 1 tsp kosher salt (for blanching)  
- 1 bunch spinach (8 oz / 227 g)

## Instructions

### 1. Prepare Ice Bath & Boiling Water
Bring a large pot of water to a boil.  
Prepare a large bowl filled with cold water and ice.

### 2. Make the Sesame Sauce
1. In a small bowl, combine tahini, soy sauce, and sugar.  
2. Mix until smooth. Thin with a splash of water if needed to loosen to a spoonable consistency.  
3. Set aside.

### 3. Blanch the Spinach
1. Add salt to the boiling water.  
2. Add spinach stems first and cook 20 seconds.  
3. Submerge leaves and cook an additional 30–45 seconds.  
4. Transfer immediately to the ice bath and chill for 1 minute.  
5. Remove and gently squeeze out excess water.

### 4. Assemble
1. Cut the drained spinach into 1-inch (2.5 cm) lengths.  
2. Place in a bowl and add the sesame dressing.
