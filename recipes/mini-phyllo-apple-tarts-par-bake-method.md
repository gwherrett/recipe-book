- 1 tbsp unsalted butter
- 1 tsp lemon juice
- ½ tsp ground cinnamon
- Pinch nutmeg (optional)
- 1 tsp flour or cornstarch (to thicken juices)

## 🍎 Method

### 1. Prepare the Filling
1. In a skillet over medium heat, melt the butter.  
2. Add diced apples, sugar, lemon juice, cinnamon, and nutmeg.  
3. Sauté for 5–6 minutes until apples just begin to soften.  
4. Stir in flour or cornstarch to absorb juices.  
5. Remove from heat and let cool slightly before filling.

### 2. Build the Phyllo Shells
1. Preheat oven to **180 °C (350 °F)**.  
2. Cut each phyllo sheet into squares (~12 cm / 5 in).  
3. Brush one square lightly with butter and press into a muffin cup.  
4. Repeat with 2 more squares per cup (3 total per tart), rotating slightly so the corners form a star shape.  
5. Repeat for all 6 muffin wells.

### 3. Par-Bake the Shells
1. Bake the empty phyllo shells for **6–7 minutes**, until just turning golden.  
2. Remove from oven and cool slightly (1–2 minutes).

---

### 4. Fill and Finish Baking
1. Spoon apple filling evenly into each par-baked shell.  
2. Return to the oven and bake another **15–18 minutes**, until phyllo is deep golden and crisp.  
3. If desired, brush with a little warm honey or apricot jam for shine.

### 5. Serve
- Cool 5 minutes in the pan, then carefully lift out.  
- Dust with powdered sugar before serving warm or at room temperature.

**Notes:**
- If apples release extra juice during cooking, drain slightly before filling.  
- You can mix in a few raisins or chopped walnuts for variation.  
- These keep 1–2 days covered at room temperature or can be gently reheated at 325 °F to crisp again.
