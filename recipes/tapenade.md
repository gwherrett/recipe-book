## Summary
A classic Provençal spread made from olives, capers, and anchovies, blended into a savory paste. Perfect as a dip with bread or vegetables, or as a condiment for sandwiches and grilled meats.

## Ingredients
- 1 cup black olives (Niçoise or Kalamata), pitted
- 2 tbsp capers, drained
- 2–3 anchovy fillets (optional but traditional)
- 1 clove garlic
- 3–4 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tsp lemon juice (optional)
- Fresh herbs (e.g., thyme, parsley) to taste

## Method
1. Combine olives, capers, anchovies, and garlic in a food processor.
2. Pulse until the mixture is roughly chopped.
3. While blending, slowly drizzle in olive oil until a coarse paste forms.
4. Add lemon juice and herbs if using. Adjust seasoning to taste.
5. Serve as a dip, spread, or condiment. Keeps for 1 week refrigerated.

## Variations
- **Green Tapenade**: Use green olives; add 1 tbsp Dijon mustard and/or 2 tbsp chopped almonds.
- **Sundried Tomato**: Add 1–2 sundried tomatoes for sweetness and depth.
- **Herb-Forward**: Use more fresh parsley or basil for a brighter, fresher flavor.

## Notes
- Great with crusty bread, crudités, or as a sandwich spread.
- Make sure to use good-quality olives for best flavor.
