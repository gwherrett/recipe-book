# Turkish-Inspired Bolognese with Celery, Carrots, and Meatballs

## Ingredients
- 2 tbsp olive oil  
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped  
- 1 medium carrot, finely diced  
- 1 celery stalk, finely diced  
- 4 cloves garlic, minced  
- 1 red bell pepper, finely diced (optional but adds a Turkish flair)  
- 1 tsp ground cumin  
- 1 tsp Aleppo pepper (or ½ tsp sweet paprika + ½ tsp chili flakes)  
- 1 tbsp tomato paste  
- 1 can (28 oz / 796 mL) crushed tomatoes  
- ½ cup water or low-sodium chicken stock  
- 1 tsp pomegranate molasses (or **1 tsp balsamic vinegar + ½ tsp honey**)  
- Salt and black pepper to taste  
- Pinch of sugar (if tomatoes are acidic)  
- 12–16 cooked meatballs  
- Chopped flat-leaf parsley or mint for garnish  

## Instructions
1. **Sauté the base**: In a large saucepan, heat olive oil over medium. Add onion, carrot, and celery. Sauté until soft and slightly golden, 10–12 minutes.  
2. **Add garlic & spices**: Stir in garlic, red bell pepper (if using), cumin, and Aleppo pepper. Cook another 2–3 minutes.  
3. **Tomato paste**: Stir in tomato paste and cook for 2 minutes to concentrate the flavor.  
4. **Build the sauce**: Pour in crushed tomatoes and water/stock. Stir in the pomegranate molasses (or substitute). Add salt, pepper, and a pinch of sugar if needed.  
5. **Simmer**: Reduce heat to low. Simmer uncovered for 25–30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it thickens.  
6. **Add meatballs**: Gently nestle in the meatballs and simmer for another 5–10 minutes to absorb flavor and heat through.  
7. **Finish**: Taste and adjust seasoning. Garnish with chopped parsley or mint.

## Serving Suggestions
Serve over **bulgur, buttery rice pilaf, or egg noodles**—or go classic with wide pasta.
