# Green Apple & Spring Mix Salad with Thai Basil Dressing

**Category:** Salads & Bowls  
**Tags:** Vegetarian, Quick, Weeknight, Thai-inspired  
**Yield:** 2–4 servings  
**Time:** 15 minutes

## Summary
A crisp, refreshing salad that balances tart green apple with tender spring mix, tossed in a bright Thai basil dressing with rice vinegar, honey, soy, and garlic. Perfect on its own or topped with grilled chicken, shrimp, or tofu.

## Ingredients

### Salad
- 5–6 cups spring mix (about 150 g)
- 1 large green apple (Granny Smith), cored and thinly sliced
- 1 small cucumber, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced (optional)
- 1 small shallot, very thinly sliced (optional)
- 1/4 cup roasted peanuts or cashews, roughly chopped
- 1 tbsp toasted sesame seeds (optional)

### Thai Basil Dressing
- 1/4 cup tightly packed Thai basil leaves, finely chopped (or chiffonade)
- 2 tbsp rice vinegar
- 1 tbsp honey (or maple syrup)
- 1 tbsp soy sauce (use tamari for gluten-free)
- 1 small garlic clove, minced
- 1/4 cup neutral or light olive oil
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- Pinch of kosher salt (to taste)

## Method
1. **Make the dressing:** In a small bowl, whisk together Thai basil, rice vinegar, honey, soy sauce, and garlic. Slowly drizzle in the oil while whisking until slightly emulsified. Season with pepper and a pinch of salt to taste.
2. **Assemble the salad:** In a large bowl, combine spring mix, apple slices, cucumber, and shallot. Add about half the dressing and toss gently to coat. Add more dressing as needed so the greens are lightly glossed, not soggy.
3. **Finish & serve:** Sprinkle with chopped peanuts/cashews and sesame seeds. Serve immediately.

## Notes & Variations
- **Heat boost:** Add thinly sliced red chili or a pinch of chili flakes.  
- **Citrus twist:** Replace half the rice vinegar with fresh lime juice.  
- **Creamier texture:** Whisk in 1–2 tsp mayo or Greek yogurt to the dressing.  
- **Protein add-ons:** Grilled chicken, shrimp, tofu, or edamame make it a fuller meal.  
- **Make-ahead:** Dressing keeps 3–4 days refrigerated. Toss with greens just before serving.
