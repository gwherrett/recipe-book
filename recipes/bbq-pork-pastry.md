## Ingredients

### For the Pastry:
- 1 pack puff pastry, cut into 24 squares
- 200 g BBQ pork (char siu), chopped
- 1 egg, beaten (for egg wash)

### For the BBQ Pork Pastry Sauce:
- 150 g sugar

- 30 g dark soy sauce
- 40 g gelatine
- 40 g corn starch mixed with 20 g water (to make slurry)

## Instructions

1. **Make the sauce:**
   Mix sugar, water, oyster sauce, dark soy sauce and gelatine in a pan. Heat until everything melts and comes to a full boil. Add cornstarch slurry to the sauce and stir until everything thickens.

2. **Cool the sauce:**
   Transfer the sauce to a sheet pan and let it cool inside the fridge until the sauce becomes jelly. Mash the jelly for later use.

3. **Mix filling:**
   Add the chopped BBQ pork to jelly and mix well.

4. **Fill pastries:**
   Roll out the puff pastry. Add chopped BBQ pork and jelly mixture to the centre of the pastry - around 10-12g.

5. **Seal and prepare for baking:**
   Roll it up and press down the two sides with a fork. Poke holes to release the steam.

6. **Bake:**
   Brush with egg wash and bake the pastry for 8-10 minutes in oven at 400°F until golden brown.

## Notes

- BBQ pork (char siu) can be purchased from Chinese BBQ shops or made at home
- The gelatine-based sauce creates a signature sticky, sweet filling
- Poke holes in the pastry to prevent bursting during baking
- Serve warm for best flavor and texture
- Can be frozen unbaked and baked from frozen (add 2-3 minutes to baking time)
