## Notes

- Traditionally uses beef drippings from a roast for authentic flavor
- The key is using a very hot pan with hot fat - this creates the dramatic rise
- Can be baked in a large pan and cut into squares, or in muffin tins for individual portions
- Must be served immediately as they deflate quickly
- Vintage handwritten recipe card
- Don't open the oven door while baking or they may collapse
