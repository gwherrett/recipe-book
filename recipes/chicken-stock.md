### Summary
A classic, deeply flavorful homemade chicken stock made by simmering chicken bones and aromatic vegetables slowly to extract maximum flavor and richness. Perfect as a base for soups, sauces, risottos, or gravies.

---

### Ingredients
- 1 whole chicken (about 1.5–2 kg) or 1.5–2 kg of chicken parts (necks, backs, wings, or legs)
- 1 large onion, quartered (unpeeled)
- 2 carrots, roughly chopped
- 2 celery stalks, roughly chopped
- 1 head garlic, halved crosswise (unpeeled)
- 1 bay leaf
- 5–6 black peppercorns
- 3–4 parsley stems or thyme sprigs (optional)
- Cold water to cover (about 3–4 L)

---

### Method
1. **Prepare the Chicken:** Rinse chicken or chicken parts under cold water. Remove excess fat but leave skin on for flavor.  
2. **Combine Ingredients:** Add chicken, vegetables, and aromatics to a large stockpot. Pour in enough cold water to cover ingredients by about 5 cm.  
3. **Bring to a Simmer:** Heat over medium-high until just boiling, then reduce to a very gentle simmer. Skim off foam or impurities that rise to the top.  
4. **Simmer Slowly:** Maintain a low simmer (barely bubbling) for 3–4 hours uncovered. Add a bit of water if needed to keep ingredients submerged.  
5. **Strain:** Remove from heat. Strain the stock through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl or container. Discard solids.  
6. **Cool & Store:** Cool to room temperature, then refrigerate overnight. Skim off fat from the surface if desired. Store up to 3 days in the fridge or 3 months in the freezer.

### Notes
- **Roasted Variation:** For a richer flavor, roast chicken bones and vegetables at 200°C (400°F) for 45 minutes before simmering.  
- **Gelatinous Stock:** Using feet or wings adds natural gelatin, giving the stock a silky texture.  
- **Storage Tip:** Freeze in ice cube trays for easy portioning.
