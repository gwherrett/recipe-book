# Croatian Lobster Pasta (Dalmatian-Style)

A coastal Croatian take on lobster pasta inspired by *brudet* flavors—tomato, white wine, olive oil, bay, and herbs—tossed with al dente pasta.

## Ingredients

### Lobster
- 2 whole lobsters (about 680 g / 1.5 lb each)
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- Fine sea salt & black pepper

### Sauce
- 3 tbsp olive oil
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp sweet paprika
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 1 tsp dried basil
- 1/2 tsp dried thyme
- 1/4–1/2 tsp red pepper flakes (optional, to taste)
- 1 × 400 g can diced tomatoes (undrained)
- 120 ml dry white wine
- 240 ml seafood stock (or water)
- 2 bay leaves
- Zest of 1 lemon
- Fine sea salt & black pepper, to taste
- Handful fresh flat-leaf parsley, chopped (for garnish)

### Pasta
- 450 g spaghetti or linguine
- Salt for pasta water

## Method

1. **Par-cook the lobster (for easy shelling).** Bring a large pot of well‑salted water to a boil. Add lobsters and cook 5 minutes, until shells turn bright red. Transfer to a tray to cool slightly. Split lengthwise; remove and roughly chop the tail, claw, and knuckle meat. Discard the sac and vein; reserve shells for stock if you like.
2. **Start the sauce.** Warm 3 tbsp olive oil in a wide sauté pan over medium heat. Sauté onion 5–7 minutes until translucent. Add garlic and cook 30 seconds until fragrant.
3. **Season.** Stir in paprika, oregano, basil, thyme, and (optional) red pepper flakes; toast 30–60 seconds.
4. **Deglaze and simmer.** Add tomatoes, wine, seafood stock, and bay leaves. Season with salt and pepper. Simmer 12–15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened and flavors meld.
5. **Cook the pasta.** Meanwhile, boil pasta in generously salted water until *al dente*. Reserve ~240 ml (1 cup) pasta water; drain.
6. **Finish with lobster.** Add chopped lobster to the sauce; simmer gently 2–3 minutes to warm through (avoid overcooking). Remove bay leaves. Add lemon zest.
7. **Toss.** Add drained pasta to the pan and toss vigorously, loosening with reserved pasta water a splash at a time until glossy and lightly saucy.
8. **Serve.** Off heat, drizzle with a little olive oil, shower with chopped parsley, and crack over black pepper. Taste and adjust salt/acid (a squeeze of lemon if needed).

## Notes & Tips
- **Pasta shape:** Linguine or spaghetti are classic; bucatini or tagliatelle also work.
- **Wine:** A crisp Croatian Pošip or any dry white (Pinot Grigio/Sauvignon Blanc) is ideal.
- **Stock swap:** If you don’t have seafood stock, simmer the reserved shells with water, onion trimmings, and a bay leaf for 20 minutes while the sauce cooks.
- **Heat level:** Croatian versions are typically mild—add chili flakes sparingly.
- **Make-ahead:** Sauce (without lobster) keeps 2–3 days refrigerated; add lobster just before serving.

Enjoy—*Dobar tek!* 🇭🇷
