## Method

### Step 1: Poach the chicken and make broth
1. In a large pot, combine the chicken thighs, water, bay leaf, peppercorns, ½ onion, and 1 celery stalk.
2. Bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat, skimming any foam that rises.
3. Reduce heat and simmer gently for about 25 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through.
4. Remove the thighs and set aside to cool slightly.
5. Strain and reserve the poaching liquid — this is your homemade chicken broth.
6. Discard the skin and bones, then shred or dice the thigh meat and set aside.

### Step 2: Build the aromatic base
1. In a large saucepan or Dutch oven, melt the butter over medium heat.
2. Add the chopped onion, celery, and diced apples. Sauté for 8–10 minutes, until softened and lightly golden.
3. Add the minced garlic and grated ginger; cook for 1 minute until fragrant.
4. Stir in the curry powder, ground coriander, turmeric, cumin, and cinnamon. Cook another 1–2 minutes to bloom the spices.

### Step 3: Simmer and purée
1. Add the rinsed lentils and 4 cups of the reserved chicken broth.
2. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer uncovered for about 25 minutes, until the lentils are tender.
3. Use an immersion blender to purée the soup to your preferred texture (smooth or slightly coarse).

### Step 4: Finish and serve
1. Stir in the coconut milk and shredded chicken. Simmer for 5 minutes to warm through.
2. Add lemon juice and season with salt and pepper to taste.
3. Ladle into bowls and garnish with chopped cilantro or parsley. Serve with lemon wedges on the side.

## Notes & Tips
- For more depth: toast the curry powder briefly in a dry pan before adding, or add a pinch of cardamom or smoked paprika.
- For sweetness balance: use 1 Granny Smith + 1 Gala for a mix of tart and sweet flavors.
- Optional add-ins: ½ cup cooked rice for body; 1 tbsp tomato paste during simmering for extra umami and acidity.
