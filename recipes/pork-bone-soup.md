### 🫒 **Ingredients**
- 800 g pork bones (neck bones, shank, or spare ribs)  
- 1/2 cup Job’s Tears (Coix seeds / adlay barley), soaked 2 hours or overnight  
- 8 cups water (2 L)  
- 3–4 slices fresh ginger  
- 1 medium onion or 2 shallots (optional, for sweetness)  
- 1 large carrot, cut into chunks (optional)  
- 2 dried red dates or 1 small piece of Chinese yam (optional, for natural sweetness)

- Scallions or cilantro, chopped — for garnish

### 🔪 **Method**
1. **Blanch the bones (for a clear broth):**  
   Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add pork bones and boil for 5 minutes to remove impurities.  
   Drain and rinse bones under cold water.  

2. **Simmer the broth:**  
   In a clean pot, add blanched bones, ginger, onion, and 8 cups fresh water.  
   Bring to a boil, then reduce to a gentle simmer. Skim off foam.  
   Add Job’s Tears, carrot, and optional red dates or yam.  

3. **Slow cook:**  
   Simmer **2–3 hours** partially covered, until broth is milky and rich, and Job’s Tears are tender but intact.  
   *(Instant Pot version: 30–40 minutes on “Soup” or “Pressure Cook,” then natural release.)*  

4. **Season:**  
   Add salt and Shaoxing wine to taste near the end.  

5. **Serve:**  
   Ladle soup into bowls, ensuring each has both bones and grains.  
   Garnish with chopped scallions or cilantro.

### 💡 **Notes**
- The Job’s Tears add a nutty, barley-like flavor and slightly thicken the soup.  
- Optional additions: goji berries, lotus seeds, or corn (add in last 30 minutes).  
- For a clear, restorative broth, strain out solids and serve as a tonic drink.
