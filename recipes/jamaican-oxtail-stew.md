# Jamaican Oxtail Recipe

## Ingredients
- 2 lbs oxtail, trimmed of excess fat
- 1 onion, chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 spring onions, chopped
- 1 Scotch bonnet pepper, chopped (optional for heat)
- 2 tbsp fresh thyme
- 2 tbsp browning sauce
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp all-purpose seasoning
- 1 tbsp black pepper
- 1 tbsp paprika
- 1 tbsp pimento (allspice) berries, crushed
- 1 tbsp tomato ketchup
- 2 tbsp cooking oil
- 1 can butter beans, drained
- 2 carrots, chopped
- 4 cups water or beef broth
- 1 tbsp brown sugar
- 1 lime or lemon (for cleaning the oxtail)

## Instructions

1. **Clean the oxtail:** Rub the oxtail with lime or lemon and rinse with water. Pat dry.

2. **Marinate the oxtail:** Season the oxtail with browning sauce, soy sauce, thyme, all-purpose seasoning, paprika, black pepper, crushed pimento berries, and garlic. Marinate for at least 2 hours or overnight for deeper flavor.

3. **Brown the oxtail:** Heat cooking oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the brown sugar and let it caramelize until it darkens. Add the oxtail and brown it on all sides, sealing in the flavors.

4. **Add aromatics:** Stir in onions, spring onions, and Scotch bonnet pepper. Sauté for 5 minutes until the onions become soft and fragrant.

5. **Add liquids:** Stir in tomato ketchup, then add water or beef broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and cover.

6. **Cook slowly:** Let the oxtail simmer on low heat for 2–3 hours, or until the meat is tender and falling off the bone. You can also use a pressure cooker to reduce cooking time.

7. **Add vegetables:** After about 2 hours, add the carrots and butter beans. Let it simmer for another 30 minutes to allow the vegetables to cook through and the sauce to thicken.

8. **Serve:** Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Serve the oxtail with rice and peas, dumplings, or fried plantains.

## Differences Between Jamaican, Saint Lucian, and Grenadian Oxtail Recipes

- **Jamaican Oxtail:** Known for its use of browning sauce and pimento (allspice), with deep, smoky flavor. Includes butter beans and caramelized brown sugar. Often spicy.

- **Saint Lucian Oxtail:** Typically includes coconut milk and green seasoning, with a fresher, creamier, and herb-focused flavor. Often milder in spice.

- **Grenadian Oxtail:** Uses aromatic spices like cloves, nutmeg, and cinnamon—hallmarks of the “Spice Isle.” Bold, fragrant, and richly seasoned.
