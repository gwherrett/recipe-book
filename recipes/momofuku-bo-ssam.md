## 🔪 Method

### 1. Cure the pork
- Place the pork in a snug roasting pan.  
- Combine 1 cup sugar + 1 cup salt; rub thoroughly over the pork. Discard excess.  
- Wrap and refrigerate at least 6 hours or overnight.

### 2. Roast low and slow
- Preheat oven to 300 °F (150 °C).  
- Discard any released juices, roast pork uncovered, basting hourly with juices/fat for ~6 hours, until a knife moves through easily and meat pulls apart.

### 3. Make sauces (can be prepped while pork cooks)
- **Ginger‑Scallion Sauce**: whisk all listed ingredients; taste and stash in fridge for 15 min minimum.  
- **Ssäm Sauce**: mix until uniform; refrigerates for weeks.

### 4. Glaze and crisp
- When pork is tender, preheat oven to 500 °F (260 °C).  
- Mix remaining 1 Tbsp salt + 7 Tbsp brown sugar; rub all over pork.  
- Roast 10–15 minutes until the sugar forms a crackly, caramelized crust.

### 5. Serve bo ssäm–style
- Slice or pull pork and let rest slightly.  
- Lay out lettuce leaves; top with rice, pork, a raw oyster, kimchi, sauces.  
- Season with coarse salt; wrap and enjoy.

## 👩‍🍳 Pro Tips

- **Make it yours**: Add roasted garlic or chili-crunch glaze for an extra kick.  
- **Cook time varies**: Some cooks report longer roast times (~12 hours) for pull-apart tenderness.  
- **More crispy skin?** Try a trotter + hock combo for extra crackle and gelatin.
