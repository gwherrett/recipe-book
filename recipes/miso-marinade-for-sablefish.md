# Classic Miso Marinade for Sablefish (Black Cod)

## Ingredients:
- **3 tbsp white miso paste** (shiro miso – milder and slightly sweet)
- **2 tbsp mirin**
- **2 tbsp sake**
- **1.5 tbsp sugar** (white or light brown – white gives cleaner flavor, brown adds depth)
- **1 tsp soy sauce** (optional – boosts umami and balances sweetness)

> ✅ *Optional:* Add ½ tsp grated ginger for brightness, or a few drops of sesame oil for extra aroma.

## Directions:

1. **Warm the marinade base**: In a small saucepan over low heat, combine miso, mirin, sake, and sugar. Stir until the sugar and miso dissolve completely – don’t boil, just warm gently.
2. **Cool & marinate**: Let it cool. Coat sablefish fillets generously with the marinade. Marinate in a sealed bag or covered dish **for 12–24 hours** in the fridge. The longer the marination, the deeper the flavor and better the caramelization.
3. **Before grilling**: Gently wipe off excess marinade (but don’t rinse). A thin coating helps caramelize without burning.
4. **Grill on soaked cedar plank** over medium heat (indirect if possible), around **12–15 minutes**, until the tips start to char and the flesh is flaky.

## Tips for Caramelization:
- **Don’t skip sugar** – that’s what gives the glaze its golden brown finish.
- **Indirect heat** helps avoid burning the marinade before the fish cooks.
- If needed, **baste lightly with marinade** in the last 5 minutes for extra gloss.
