# Frozen Banana Cocoa Ice Cream

**Category:** Desserts → Frozen Treats  
**Serves:** 2–4  
**Time:** 5 min prep (+ 2–8 hrs freezing)

## Ingredients
- 4 ripe bananas
- 2 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 tsp vanilla extract *(optional)*
- Pinch of salt *(optional)*
- Sweetener to taste — honey, maple syrup, or sugar *(optional)*

## Instructions
1. **Freeze bananas:** Peel and slice bananas. Freeze until solid (2–8 hours or overnight).
2. **Blend:** Add frozen banana slices to a high‑powered blender or food processor. Blend, scraping down sides as needed, until creamy.
3. **Flavor:** Add cocoa powder, vanilla, and salt. Blend to combine. Taste and add sweetener if desired; blend again.
4. **Set texture:** Serve immediately for soft‑serve. For a firmer scoop, transfer to a lidded container and freeze 1–3 hours.

## Tips
- If the mixture won’t blend, add 1–2 tbsp milk (dairy or non‑dairy) to help it along.
- For easier scooping after a longer freeze, let the container sit at room temp for 5–10 minutes.

## Variations
- **Chunky monkey:** Fold in chopped walnuts and chocolate chips.
- **Mocha:** Add 1 tsp instant espresso powder.
- **Peanut butter cup:** Blend in 1–2 tbsp peanut butter.
- **Mint chocolate:** Add 1/4 tsp peppermint extract and fold in cacao nibs.

Enjoy!
