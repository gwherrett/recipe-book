# 🧀 Classic Blue Cheese Dressing

A creamy, tangy blue cheese dressing perfect for a wedge salad.

## Ingredients

- **1/2 cup** sour cream  
- **1/4 cup** mayonnaise  
- **2 tbsp** buttermilk (or milk with a splash of vinegar or lemon juice)  
- **1 tsp** white wine vinegar (or lemon juice)  
- **1/4 tsp** garlic powder  
- **1/4 tsp** black pepper  
- **1/8 tsp** salt  
- **1/2 cup** crumbled blue cheese (e.g., Gorgonzola or Roquefort)

### Optional:
- **1 tsp** Worcestershire sauce (for umami depth)

## Instructions

1. **Mix Base**: In a small bowl, whisk together the sour cream, mayo, buttermilk, vinegar, garlic powder, pepper, and salt until smooth.  
2. **Fold in Cheese**: Add the blue cheese and gently mash some into the dressing with a fork while leaving some chunks for texture.  
3. **Chill**: Let sit for at least 20 minutes (or up to 2 days in the fridge) to let the flavors meld.
