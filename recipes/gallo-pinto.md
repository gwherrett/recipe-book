# Gallo Pinto with Cumin, Coriander, and Rice Cooked in Chicken Broth

## Ingredients
- 1 cup uncooked white rice  
- 2 cups chicken broth (for cooking rice)  
- 1 cup cooked black beans (with some liquid, or canned beans, drained)  
- 1/4 cup finely chopped onion  
- 1/4 cup finely chopped red bell pepper (optional)  
- 1 clove garlic, minced  
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil  
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin  
- 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander  
- 2 tablespoons Salsa Lizano (or Worcestershire sauce as a substitute)  
- Salt and pepper to taste  
- Fresh cilantro, chopped (optional, for garnish)

## Instructions

1. **Cook the Rice**  
   In a medium saucepan, combine the uncooked rice and chicken broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer until the rice is cooked and the liquid is absorbed (about 15-20 minutes). Fluff the rice with a fork and set aside.

2. **Cook Aromatics**  
   Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, red bell pepper, and garlic. Sauté until the onions are soft and translucent, about 3-5 minutes.

3. **Add Spices**  
   Stir in the ground cumin and coriander. Cook for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.

4. **Add Beans**  
   Stir in the black beans along with a small amount of their liquid (about 2-3 tablespoons). Cook for 2-3 minutes to combine the flavors.

5. **Mix in Rice**  
   Add the cooked rice to the skillet and mix well with the beans and vegetables. Stir continuously to ensure even distribution and prevent sticking.

6. **Season**  
   Stir in the Salsa Lizano or Worcestershire sauce, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cook for an additional 3-5 minutes, allowing the rice to absorb the spices and flavors.

7. **Serve**  
   Garnish with fresh cilantro if desired. Serve hot as a main dish or a side, pairing it with fried eggs, tortillas, avocado, or plantains for a traditional touch.

## Tips
- Cooking the rice in chicken broth adds a deeper, savory flavor to the dish.  
- Adjust cumin and coriander to your preference for a more robust, spiced flavor.  
- If you like heat, add a pinch of chili powder or diced jalapeño.
