## Instructions

1. **Prepare the casserole:**
   Pour maple syrup into the bottom of a casserole dish to a depth of about 1 inch.

2. **Make the batter:**
   Cream together shortening and sugar. Add milk and mix well. In a separate bowl, combine flour, baking powder, and salt. Add dry ingredients to wet ingredients and mix until just combined.

3. **Assemble and bake:**
   Drop spoonfuls of batter over the maple syrup in the casserole (do not stir). Bake at 350°F for 40 minutes, until the top is golden and set.

4. **Serve:**
   Serve warm, spooning the maple syrup sauce from the bottom over each portion. Excellent with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream.

## Notes

- The batter will rise and cook on top while the maple syrup creates a sauce underneath
- Use pure maple syrup for best flavor
- Best served warm from the oven
- Traditional comfort food dessert, likely Canadian or New England origin
