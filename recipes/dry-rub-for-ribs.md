# Ultimate Dry Rub for Ribs

## Description
This dry rub strikes the perfect balance of sweet, smoky, and spicy flavors, ideal for pork ribs but versatile enough for other meats.

## Instructions
1. **Mix Ingredients**: Combine all ingredients in a mixing bowl and whisk to ensure even distribution.
2. **Prepare the Ribs**: Pat the ribs dry and generously coat them with the rub, pressing it into the meat.
3. **Rest the Ribs**: Allow the ribs to sit for at least 30 minutes at room temperature, or refrigerate overnight for deeper flavor.
4. **Cook**: Smoke or grill the ribs using your preferred method. The rub will help create a flavorful bark.

- 1 tbsp black pepper
- 1 tbsp garlic powder
- 1 tbsp onion powder
