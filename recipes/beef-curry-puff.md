## Instructions

1. **Cook vegetables:**
   Sauté onion, celery, and carrot until softened. Add ground beef to the mix until it is browned.

2. **Season the filling:**
   Add curry powder, sugar and chicken powder to the mix. Cook down for 5 more minutes.

3. **Thicken:**
   Add cornstarch directly to the mix and cook until all thickens.

4. **Cool:**
   Take it out for cooling.

5. **Fill pastries:**
   Unroll the puff pastry. Add the beef mixture to the centre, then fold the pastry into a triangle. Poke the side and the centre to release steam.

6. **Bake:**
   Brush with egg wash and bake for 8-10 minutes in oven at 400°F, until golden brown.

## Notes

- The cornstarch creates a thick, non-runny filling that's perfect for pastries
- Make sure filling is completely cooled before assembling to prevent soggy pastry
- Seal edges well by pressing with a fork to prevent leaking
- Can be made ahead and frozen unbaked
- Poke holes in the pastry to allow steam to escape during baking
- Great for parties, snacks, or lunch boxes
