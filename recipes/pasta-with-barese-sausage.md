# Pasta with Barese Sausage

## Ingredients
- 12 oz (340 g) Barese sausage, casings removed and crumbled  
- 12 oz (340 g) short pasta (penne, rigatoni, or orecchiette)  
- 2 tbsp olive oil  
- 1 small onion, finely chopped  
- 2 cloves garlic, minced  
- 1 can (14.5 oz / ~400 g) crushed tomatoes  
- 1/4 cup dry red wine *(optional)*  
- 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes *(to taste)*  
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper  
- Handful fresh basil leaves, chopped (for garnish)  
- Grated Pecorino Romano, for serving *(optional)*  

## Method
1. **Brown the sausage.** Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add crumbled Barese sausage and cook, breaking it up, until browned. Transfer sausage to a plate, leaving the fat in the pan.
2. **Sauté aromatics.** Add onion and garlic to the skillet. Cook 2–3 minutes until translucent and fragrant.
3. **Deglaze (optional).** Pour in red wine and simmer 1–2 minutes to reduce slightly.
4. **Simmer the sauce.** Stir in crushed tomatoes and red pepper flakes. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low and cook 10–15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Season with salt and pepper.
5. **Cook the pasta.** Meanwhile, boil pasta in well‑salted water until *al dente*. Reserve 1/2 cup pasta water, then drain.
6. **Combine.** Return sausage to the sauce and warm through 1–2 minutes. Toss in drained pasta, adding splashes of reserved pasta water as needed to help the sauce cling.
7. **Finish & serve.** Plate and top with basil and Pecorino Romano.

## Notes
- Barese sausage is a fresh Italian pork sausage seasoned with parsley, cheese, and sometimes tomato—use sweet or mildly spicy varieties.
- Add a handful of baby spinach in the last minute of cooking for extra greens.
- Swap in canned cherry tomatoes for a chunkier sauce.
