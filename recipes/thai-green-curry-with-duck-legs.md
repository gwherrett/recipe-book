# Thai Green Curry with Duck Legs

A fragrant, creamy Thai green curry made with chopped duck legs and a homemade curry paste.

## Ingredients

- 2 duck legs, **skin and fat removed**, chopped into 2-inch pieces  
- 2 tbsp Thai green curry paste (homemade)  
- 400ml coconut milk  
- 250ml chicken stock (or water)  
- 2 tbsp fish sauce  
- 1 tsp palm sugar (or brown sugar)  
- 2 kaffir lime leaves, torn  
- 1 small Thai eggplant, quartered (or substitute with zucchini)  
- 100g bamboo shoots (optional)  
- 1 red chili, sliced (optional, for garnish)  
- Handful of Thai basil leaves  
- Juice of ½ lime  
- 1 tbsp vegetable oil

## Method

1. **Sear the Duck (Optional but Recommended)**  
   Heat 1 tbsp vegetable oil in a pot over medium-high heat.  
   Sear the duck pieces for 2–3 minutes until lightly browned.  
   Remove and set aside.

2. **Cook the Curry Paste**  
   In the same pot, add 2 tbsp of your homemade Thai green curry paste.  
   Cook for 1–2 minutes until fragrant.

3. **Simmer the Duck**  
   Add the duck pieces back into the pot.  
   Pour in the coconut milk and chicken stock.  
   Add kaffir lime leaves and palm sugar.  
   Bring to a gentle simmer and cook uncovered for 35–40 minutes, stirring occasionally.

4. **Add Vegetables**  
   After 30 minutes of simmering, add Thai eggplant and bamboo shoots.  
   Continue to simmer for another 10–15 minutes until duck is tender and vegetables are cooked.

5. **Final Seasoning**  
   Stir in fish sauce and lime juice.  
   Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.

6. **Finish & Serve**  
   Turn off the heat and stir in Thai basil leaves.  
   Garnish with sliced red chili if desired.  
   Serve with steamed jasmine rice.
