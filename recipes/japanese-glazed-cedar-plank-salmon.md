# Japanese-Glazed Cedar Plank Salmon

A simple, flavorful Japanese-style glaze perfect for cedar plank salmon on the grill.

## Ingredients

- 1/4 cup soy sauce (low sodium recommended)  
- 2 tablespoons mirin (Japanese sweet rice wine)  
- 2 tablespoons sake (or substitute with rice vinegar)  
- 2 tablespoons honey or maple syrup  
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil  
- 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger  
- 2 garlic cloves, minced  
- 1 tablespoon miso paste (optional, but adds depth)  
- 1 teaspoon rice vinegar (for tang)  
- Sesame seeds and chopped green onions (for garnish)

## Instructions

### 1. Prepare the Cedar Plank
Soak the cedar plank in water for at least 1 hour to prevent burning on the grill.

### 2. Make the Glaze
In a small saucepan, combine:
- Soy sauce  
- Mirin  
- Sake  
- Honey  
- Sesame oil  
- Ginger  
- Garlic  
- Miso paste  
- Rice vinegar  

Simmer over medium heat until slightly thickened (about 5 minutes). Remove from heat and let cool.

### 3. Glaze the Salmon
Brush the salmon fillets generously with the glaze, covering all sides. Marinate for 20–30 minutes.

### 4. Grill the Salmon
Preheat grill to medium. Place the soaked cedar plank on the grill for a few minutes until it starts to smoke.  
Then place the salmon on the plank, skin side down.  
Grill with the lid closed for 15–20 minutes, or until the salmon flakes easily.

### 5. Garnish and Serve
Remove salmon from the grill and sprinkle with sesame seeds and chopped green onions.

## Notes

- Substitute sake with additional mirin or rice vinegar if needed.
- Use maple syrup for a Canadian twist.
- Serve with rice and steamed vegetables for a complete meal.
