# mediterranean yellow lentil & chicken soup

### ingredients
- 2 tbsp olive oil (or butter, if you prefer richer flavor)
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 2 carrots, diced
- 2 garlic cloves, minced (optional but recommended)
- 1 tbsp tomato paste (or a little canned tomato if you have it)
- 1 ½ cups yellow lentils (red also works)
- 6 cups chicken stock
- 1 poached chicken breast, shredded or cut into small chunks
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- ½ tsp ground coriander (optional, nice Mediterranean touch)
- ½ tsp paprika or Aleppo pepper (pul biber, if you have it)
- Salt & black pepper, to taste

### garnishes
- Fresh parsley, chopped
- Fresh cilantro, chopped
- Lemon wedges
- Drizzle of olive oil or chili-infused butter

### instructions
1. **sauté the base:** In a large pot, heat olive oil. Add onion and carrots, cook until softened (5–7 minutes). Add garlic and tomato paste, cook 1–2 minutes until fragrant.
2. **add lentils & stock:** Stir in lentils, cumin, coriander, and paprika. Pour in chicken stock, bring to a boil, then reduce to simmer.
3. **simmer:** Cook uncovered 20–25 minutes, until lentils and carrots are soft.
4. **blend (optional):** Use an immersion blender to partially purée — leave a bit of texture since you’ll add chicken.
5. **add chicken:** Stir in shredded poached chicken breast. Simmer 5 more minutes to heat through. Adjust seasoning with salt & pepper.
6. **serve:** Ladle into bowls, top with parsley, cilantro, and a squeeze of lemon. Optionally drizzle with olive oil or chili butter.
