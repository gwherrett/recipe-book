# Air Fryer Buffalo Cauliflower (Classic Version)

## Ingredients

### Cauliflower
- 1 medium cauliflower, cut into bite-size florets  
- 2 tbsp olive oil  
- 1 tsp kosher salt  
- 1 tsp garlic powder  
- ½ tsp onion powder  
- ½ tsp smoked paprika  
- 1 tbsp cornstarch  

### Buffalo Sauce
- 4 tbsp unsalted butter  
- 4 tbsp Frank’s RedHot Original  
- 1 tsp white vinegar  
- ½ tsp Worcestershire sauce  
- ¼ tsp garlic powder  
- Pinch of cayenne (optional)

## Method

1. **Prep the cauliflower:**  
   Toss florets with olive oil, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, and cornstarch until evenly coated.

2. **Air fry:**  
   Preheat air fryer to **400°F (205°C)**.  
   Arrange cauliflower in a single layer.  
   Cook **12–15 minutes**, shaking halfway, until browned and crisp at the edges.  
   Cook 3–4 minutes longer if you prefer extra crispness.

3. **Make the Buffalo sauce:**  
   Gently melt butter.  
   Whisk in Frank’s RedHot, white vinegar, Worcestershire, garlic powder, and cayenne.

4. **Finish:**  
   Toss hot cauliflower with the Buffalo sauce until coated.  
   Serve immediately with celery, carrots, and dressing of choice.

## Notes
- Add extra vinegar for a sharper Buffalo flavour.  
- For a batter-style crust, use a flour-and-milk dredge before air frying.  
- Works with frozen cauliflower; add 3–5 minutes to the cooking time.
