# Salmon With Dijon Brown Sugar

A simple and delicious salmon recipe with a sweet and tangy glaze.

## Ingredients
- 4 salmon fillets  
- Salt and pepper, to taste  
- 1/4 cup Dijon mustard  
- 1/4 cup brown sugar  
- 1 tablespoon olive oil  
- 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped (optional for garnish)

## Instructions
1. **Preheat the Oven:** Set your oven to 400°F (200°C).
2. **Season the Salmon:** Pat the salmon fillets dry with paper towels. Season both sides with salt and pepper.
3. **Prepare the Glaze:** In a small bowl, mix together the Dijon mustard and brown sugar until well combined.
4. **Glaze the Salmon:** Place the salmon fillets on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or lightly greased foil. Brush the Dijon brown sugar mixture over the top of each fillet, covering them generously.
5. **Bake:** Place the salmon in the preheated oven and bake for about 12-15 minutes, or until the salmon is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork. The cooking time may vary depending on the thickness of the fillets.
6. **Serve:** Remove the salmon from the oven, drizzle with olive oil, and garnish with chopped parsley if using. Serve immediately.

Great with rice, quinoa, or roasted vegetables.
