# Japanese Curry

## Ingredients

### For the Curry Roux:
- 3 tbsp butter
- 3 tbsp flour
- 2 tbsp curry powder
- 1 tbsp garam masala
- 1 tbsp ketchup
- 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce

### For the Curry:
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil
- 1 large onion, sliced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 inch ginger, minced
- 1 lb (450g) chicken thigh or breast, cut into bite-sized pieces (can substitute with beef or pork)
- 3 medium potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks
- 2 medium carrots, peeled and cut into chunks
- 4 cups chicken or vegetable broth
- 1 apple, grated (optional)
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Curry Roux:**
   - In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.
   - Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until it turns a light brown color, about 10 minutes.
   - Add curry powder, garam masala, ketchup, and Worcestershire sauce. Mix well and cook for another 1-2 minutes.
   - Remove from heat and set aside.

2. **Prepare the Curry:**
   - Heat vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat.
   - Add onions and sauté until they become soft and translucent.
   - Add garlic and ginger, and sauté for another minute until fragrant.
   - Add the chicken pieces and cook until browned on all sides.
   - Add potatoes and carrots, and stir to combine.
   - Pour in the broth and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 20 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender.
   - Stir in the grated apple (if using).

3. **Combine Roux and Curry:**
   - Take a ladleful of the hot broth from the pot and mix it into the curry roux to make a smooth paste.
   - Gradually add the roux mixture back into the pot, stirring constantly to combine.
   - Simmer for an additional 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the curry thickens.
   - Season with salt and pepper to taste.

4. **Serve:**
   - Serve the curry over steamed white rice.
   - Optionally, garnish with chopped green onions or cilantro.

Enjoy your homemade Japanese curry!
