2. **Warm Dairy:**  
   In a small pan, gently warm the butter and cream. *(Optional: add a smashed garlic clove for extra depth, then discard it.)*

3. **Mash:**  
   Mash the drained potatoes, then stir in the warm butter/cream, sour cream, and horseradish.

4. **Season:**  
   Add salt and pepper. Taste and adjust horseradish if you want more zing.

5. **Garnish & Serve:**  
   Top with chopped chives or green onions if desired. Serve hot.

## Tips

- For extra richness, use cream cheese instead of sour cream.
- Add a splash of Dijon mustard for a more complex tang.
- Don’t overmix or you risk gummy potatoes.
