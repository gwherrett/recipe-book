# Pecan Pie (No Corn Syrup)

### Category: Desserts

#### Summary
A smaller 6-inch version of the classic pecan pie made without corn syrup. This version replaces the syrup with pure maple syrup and dates, resulting in a naturally sweet, rich, and nutty filling.

### Ingredients (⅓ of Original Recipe)
- 1 small pie crust (6-inch, or half of a store-bought crust)
- 1 cup pecans (whole or chopped)
- 1 large egg
- ¼ cup pitted dates
- ¼ cup pure maple syrup
- 1 ½ tbsp light brown sugar (packed)
- 2 tsp unsalted butter (melted)
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- Pinch of salt (~1⁄16 tsp)

---

### Method
1. **Preheat oven** to 350 °F (175 °C).
2. **Toast pecans** on a baking sheet for 10–12 minutes until fragrant. Let cool.
3. **Blend filling:** Combine egg, dates, maple syrup, brown sugar, melted butter, vanilla, and salt in a blender. Blend until smooth.
4. **Assemble:** Scatter about ⅔ cup of the toasted pecans into the pie crust. Pour in the filling and top decoratively with remaining pecans.
5. **Bake** for 25–30 minutes, until the center is just set.
6. **Cool** for at least 1 hour before slicing.

### Notes
- Makes 1 small (6-inch) pie, 2–3 servings.
- Add 1 tsp bourbon or espresso for a deeper flavor.
- Filling firms as it cools; serve with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.
