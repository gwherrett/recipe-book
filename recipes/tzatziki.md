# Tzatziki (Greek Yogurt–Cucumber Dip)

**Category:** Condiments & Sauces → Dips  
**Tags:** Greek, yogurt, cucumber, garlic, dill  
**Time:** 15 min active (+1 hr chill)  
**Yield:** ~2½ cups

## Summary
A cool, garlicky yogurt dip with grated cucumber, olive oil, lemon (or vinegar), and dill. Perfect with pita, grilled meats, gyros, falafel, or raw veg.

## Ingredients
- 2 cups (450–500 g) thick Greek yogurt (full‑fat preferred)
- 1 large cucumber (~300 g), peeled, seeded, and coarsely grated
- 2–3 cloves garlic, very finely minced or grated
- 2 tbsp extra‑virgin olive oil
- 1–1½ tbsp fresh lemon juice **or** white wine vinegar
- 1–2 tbsp fresh dill, finely chopped (optional but traditional)
- ¼–½ tsp fine sea salt, to taste
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- Optional: 1–2 tbsp fresh mint, finely chopped

## Method
1. **Drain cucumber (key for thick tzatziki):** Place the grated cucumber in a fine sieve or cheesecloth, lightly salt, and squeeze out as much liquid as possible. Set aside.
2. **(Optional) Strain yogurt:** If your yogurt isn’t very thick, line a sieve with cheesecloth and drain 30–60 minutes in the fridge.
3. **Mix:** In a bowl, combine yogurt, squeezed cucumber, garlic, olive oil, lemon juice (or vinegar), dill, salt, and pepper. Stir until smooth and creamy. Adjust acidity and salt.
4. **Chill:** Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour (and up to 24 hours) to let flavors meld.
5. **Serve:** Drizzle with a little olive oil and a pinch of dill. Serve with warm pita, crudités, or alongside grilled lamb/chicken, souvlaki, or gyros.

## Notes & Tips
- **Texture control:** For thinner tzatziki, reserve a tablespoon of cucumber juice to stir back in as needed.  
- **Garlic strength:** Freshly grated garlic blooms as it rests; start with less if unsure.  
- **Herb swaps:** Mint can replace or complement dill.  
- **Make‑ahead:** Keeps 3–4 days refrigerated in an airtight container. Stir before serving.
