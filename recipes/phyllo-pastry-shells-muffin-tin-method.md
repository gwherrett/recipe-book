# Phyllo Pastry Shells (Muffin Tin Method)

### Category
Pastry & Shells

### Summary
Crisp, golden phyllo shells baked in a muffin tin — perfect for both sweet and savory fillings. Quick to make, store well, and elevate any appetizer or dessert presentation.

---

### Ingredients
- 6–8 sheets phyllo pastry (thawed if frozen)  
- 3–4 tbsp butter, melted (or olive oil for savory fillings)  
- Optional: sugar for sweet shells, or grated parmesan/sesame seeds for savory versions  

---

### Method
1. **Preheat oven** to 350°F (175°C).  
2. **Prepare phyllo:** Lay one sheet flat, brush lightly with melted butter. Layer another sheet on top and repeat until you have 3–4 layers.  
3. **Cut squares:** Using a sharp knife or scissors, cut the layered phyllo into 4–5 inch (10–12 cm) squares.  
4. **Fit into muffin tin:** Gently press each square stack into a muffin cup, allowing edges to ruffle naturally. For sturdier shells, add a second square diagonally on top.  
5. **Bake:** Place the muffin tin in the oven and bake for 8–12 minutes, until the shells are golden and crisp.  
6. **Cool:** Let cool in the tin for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack.

### Tips
- **Extra Crunch:** Sprinkle sugar (sweet) or parmesan/sesame seeds (savory) between layers.  
- **Make Ahead:** Bake shells up to 2 days in advance. Store in an airtight container and re-crisp in the oven for 3–4 minutes before filling.  
- **Fill After Baking:** Ideal for creamy or moist fillings like lemon curd, mousse, whipped cream with fruit, or savory mixtures such as spanakopita, crab salad, or roasted vegetables.

### Notes
These shells are versatile and elegant—serve them as bite-sized desserts or hors d'oeuvres. Perfect for entertaining or elevating leftovers into something special.
