## Instructions

1. **Toast the dry spices:** In a dry skillet over medium heat, toast coriander, cumin, cardamom, cloves, and peppercorns for 1–2 minutes until fragrant. Grind into a fine powder using a spice grinder or mortar & pestle. Stir in ground cinnamon and nutmeg.  
2. **Prep the chilies:** Drain soaked chilies, then roughly chop.  
3. **Pound or blend:** In a mortar & pestle (traditional) or food processor (modern), pound/blend the chilies, lemongrass, galangal, ginger, shallot, garlic, shrimp paste, and lime zest/leaves into a smooth paste. Add a splash of water if blending.  
4. **Combine:** Mix in the ground spice blend until fully incorporated.  
5. **Store:** Keep in an airtight jar in the fridge for up to 1 week, or freeze in portions for 3 months.

### 💡 Notes
- What makes **Massaman curry paste** different from other Thai curry pastes is that **half the flavor comes from toasted dry spices**—something you won’t find in red or green curry pastes, which rely almost entirely on fresh herbs and chilies.
