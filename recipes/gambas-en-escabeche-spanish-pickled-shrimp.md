## Instructions

1. **Poach the Shrimp**  
   Bring a pot of salted water to a gentle simmer. Add shrimp and cook for 1–2 minutes, just until pink and opaque. Drain and set aside to cool.

2. **Make the Escabeche Marinade**  
   In a skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add garlic and onion; sauté until soft but not browned (about 5–7 minutes).  
   Add bay leaf, both paprikas, peppercorns, salt, red pepper flakes (if using), vinegar, and wine. Simmer for 2–3 minutes to meld the flavors.

3. **Combine**  
   Place the cooked shrimp in a glass or ceramic dish (not metal). Pour the warm escabeche marinade over the shrimp, ensuring they’re fully covered. Let it cool, then cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours (overnight is best).

4. **Serve**  
   Bring to room temperature before serving. Garnish with fresh parsley or thyme. Serve with crusty bread, olives, or as part of a tapas board.
