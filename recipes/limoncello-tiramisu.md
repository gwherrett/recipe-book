# Limoncello Tiramisu

**Time:** 25 min active, 4–12 hr chill  
**Serves:** 8–10

## Summary
A bright, lemony twist on the classic tiramisu. Ladyfingers are dipped in a lemon–Limoncello syrup and layered with a soft, mascarpone‑Limoncello cream. Perfect make‑ahead dessert.

## Ingredients
- 4 large egg yolks
- 1/2 cup (100 g) sugar, divided
- 1/2 cup (120 ml) Limoncello liqueur, divided
- 3/4 cup (180 ml) fresh lemon juice
- 3/4 cup (180 ml) water, divided
- 1 cup (225 g) mascarpone, cold
- 1 cup (240 ml) heavy cream, cold
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 (200–250 g) package ladyfinger cookies (savoiardi)
- Finely grated lemon zest, for garnish

## Method

### 1) Make the lemon syrup
In a small saucepan, combine **1/2 cup (120 ml) water**, **3/4 cup (180 ml) lemon juice**, and **1/4 cup (50 g) sugar**. Bring to a bare simmer, stirring until the sugar dissolves. Remove from heat and cool to room temperature, then stir in **1/4 cup (60 ml) Limoncello**.

### 2) Make the Limoncello cream
In a mixing bowl, whisk **4 egg yolks** with the remaining **1/4 cup (50 g) sugar** and **1/4 cup (60 ml) Limoncello** until thick and pale. In a separate bowl, whisk **1 cup mascarpone** with **1 tsp vanilla** until smooth. In a third bowl, whip **1 cup heavy cream** to soft peaks. Fold the mascarpone into the yolk mixture until just combined, then gently fold in the whipped cream.

> Cooked‑egg option: For a safer, custard‑style base, whisk yolks, sugar, 1/4 cup water, and Limoncello over a gently simmering bain‑marie to 160°F/71°C, then cool before proceeding.

### 3) Assemble
Quickly dip each ladyfinger in the **lemon syrup** (do not soak). Arrange a single layer in a 9×9‑inch (23×23 cm) dish. Spread half the **Limoncello cream** over top. Repeat with another layer of dipped ladyfingers and the remaining cream.

### 4) Chill
Cover and refrigerate for **at least 4 hours** (overnight recommended) to set and meld flavors.

### 5) Serve
Garnish with **lemon zest**. Slice and serve cold.

## Notes & Tips
- **Make‑ahead:** Keeps 2–3 days refrigerated; flavor improves by day 2.
- **Pan sizes:** Also fits an 8×10‑inch (20×25 cm) pan or 8–10 individual glasses.
