## Instructions

1. **Make the Patties:**  
   Gently mix beef with salt, pepper, and optional spices.  
   Divide into 4 equal portions (about 4 oz each), form into patties slightly wider than your buns.  
   Press a shallow dimple in the center of each to prevent puffing.

2. **Cook the Patties:**  
   Preheat grill or pan to medium-high heat.  
   Cook 3–4 minutes per side for medium, adding cheese in the last minute of cooking.  
   Let rest 2 minutes off-heat.

3. **Toast the Buns:**  
   Spread a little butter on the cut sides of the buns.  
   Toast on grill or skillet until golden brown.

4. **Assemble:**  
   Layer the base with sauce, lettuce, patty, tomato, pickles, onion, and top bun.

## Notes
- For **smash burgers**, use a hot cast iron pan and press down patties thin while cooking.
- Customize with sauces like chipotle mayo, BBQ sauce, or spicy ketchup.
