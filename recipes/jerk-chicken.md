- 6 garlic cloves  
- 2 tbsp fresh thyme leaves  
- 1 tbsp ground allspice  
- 1 tsp freshly grated nutmeg  
- 2 tbsp dark brown sugar  
- ½ cup soy sauce  
- 2 tbsp lime zest and ¼ cup lime juice (about 4 limes)  
- ¼ cup olive oil  
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

- ¼ cup whole allspice berries  
- 2 cups dried bay leaves (about 3 dozen)

## Method

1. **Make the marinade:**  
   Combine Scotch bonnets, scallions, ginger, garlic, thyme, ground allspice, nutmeg, brown sugar, soy sauce, lime zest & juice, olive oil, 1 tbsp salt, and 2 tsp black pepper in a blender or food processor. Blend about 1 minute until a rough purée forms.

2. **Marinate the chicken:**  
   Divide marinade between two large zip-top bags or a covered dish. Add chicken halves and coat thoroughly.  
   Refrigerate and marinate **10–24 hours**.

3. **Prepare the smoker box:**  
   - Soak the **bay leaves** (and optionally the whole allspice berries) in water for at least 30 minutes.  
   - Drain, then place in your smoker box.  
   - Preheat your **gas grill** to **medium-high** (around 400 °F / 200 °C) with the smoker box over one burner.  
   - Close the lid and allow smoke to build for about 5 minutes.

4. **Grill the chicken:**  
   - Oil the grate lightly.  
   - Place the chicken skin-side up over the cooler side of the grill (indirect heat), with the smoker box active.  
   - Cover and cook about 30 minutes.  
   - Rotate as needed, maintaining gentle smoke and even heat (~350–400 °F).  
   - Continue cooking until the thickest part of the breast registers **150–155 °F (66–68 °C)** and the thighs **170 °F (77 °C)** — about 60 minutes total depending on grill and size.

5. **Finish over direct heat:**  
   Move the chicken skin-side down over direct heat to crisp and lightly char, 3–5 minutes.  
   Watch closely to avoid burning — the sugar in the marinade caramelizes quickly.

6. **Rest and serve:**  
   Transfer to a platter, tent loosely with foil, and rest 5 minutes before carving.  
   Serve with rice & peas, grilled plantains, or cabbage slaw.

## Notes
- Using a smoker box keeps cleanup simple and delivers the same fragrant **bay-leaf smoke** Kenji achieves with charcoal.  
- For extra authenticity, mix in **pimento wood chips** or **applewood** with the bay leaves.  
- Control the heat — jerk is meant to be smoky and spicy, not burnt.  
- If you like, reserve a few spoonfuls of fresh (un-used) marinade to drizzle over finished chicken for brightness.
