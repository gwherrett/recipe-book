# Thai Green Curry Paste (Halved Batch)

This recipe makes enough curry paste for about **two curries**. The paste keeps for about a month in the refrigerator.

## Ingredients

- **½ tablespoon coriander seeds**  
- **1 teaspoon cumin seeds**  
- **½ teaspoon black peppercorns**  
- **2 tablespoons minced coriander roots**  
- **¾ teaspoon salt**  
- **¼ cup minced lemongrass (2 to 4 stalks)**  
- **2 tablespoons coarsely chopped garlic**  
- **2 tablespoons coarsely chopped shallots**  
- **1 tablespoon chopped galangal**, or substitute **½ tablespoon minced ginger + ½ tablespoon fresh lime juice**  
- **½ tablespoon minced wild lime zest**, or substitute **regular lime zest**  
- **¼ cup bird chiles** (preferably green ones), stemmed and coarsely chopped  
- **½ tablespoon shrimp paste**

## Notes

- A mortar and pestle will yield the smoothest paste, but a blender or food processor can also be used.
- This halved batch is perfect for smaller households or when experimenting with new curry recipes.
