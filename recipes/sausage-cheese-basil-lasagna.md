## Ingredients
- 1 lb Italian sausage (mild or spicy)  
- 1 large onion, chopped  
- 3 cloves garlic, minced  
- 1 can (28 oz) crushed tomatoes  
- 2 tbsp tomato paste  
- 2 tbsp fresh basil, chopped (plus extra for garnish)  
- 1 tsp dried oregano  
- 1 lb ricotta cheese  
- 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese  
- ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese  
- 1 large egg  
- 9 lasagna noodles (cooked al dente)  
- Olive oil  
- Salt & pepper, to taste  

## Method
1. **Make Sauce:** Sauté sausage until browned. Add onion and garlic; cook until soft. Stir in tomatoes, paste, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Simmer 15–20 minutes.  
2. **Prepare Cheese Mixture:** In a bowl, combine ricotta, egg, and half the Parmesan. Season lightly.  
3. **Assemble:** Spread a thin layer of sauce in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Layer noodles, ricotta mixture, mozzarella, and sauce. Repeat twice, ending with sauce and remaining cheeses on top.  
4. **Bake:** Cover with foil; bake at 375°F (190°C) for 25 minutes. Uncover and bake another 15–20 minutes until bubbly and golden.  
5. **Rest & Serve:** Let stand 10 minutes before slicing. Garnish with fresh basil.
