## Steamed Pork Patty (蒸肉餅)

### Ingredients
- 400 g ground pork (70% lean, 30% fat)
- 2 tbsp light soy sauce
- 1 tbsp oyster sauce
- ½ tsp dark soy sauce (optional, for color)
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- 1 tbsp Shaoxing wine
- 1 tbsp cornstarch
- 2–3 tbsp water (to loosen mixture)
- 1 thumb-sized piece of ginger, finely grated (about 1 tbsp)
- 2 green onions, finely chopped
- *Optional toppings:* sliced salted duck egg yolk, dried shrimp (soaked), or chopped water chestnuts for crunch

### Method
1. Mix pork with soy sauces, oyster sauce, sugar, sesame oil, Shaoxing wine, and cornstarch. Stir in one direction 2–3 minutes until sticky. Gradually add water.
2. Fold in ginger, green onions, and optional add-ins.
3. Spread mixture (1.5–2 cm thick) on a heatproof plate; smooth top.
4. Steam over boiling water for 12–15 minutes, until juices run clear or internal temp is 75°C / 165°F.
5. Drizzle with soy sauce or hot oil before serving.

### Notes
- Add dried shrimp or preserved mustard greens (梅菜) for extra umami.
- Reheat by steaming 5 minutes.
- Variations: add salted fish (咸鱼) or mix in water chestnuts/mushrooms for texture.
