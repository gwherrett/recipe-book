## Preparation
1. Heat the broth in a large pot and stir in saffron.
2. Pat fish and shrimp dry with paper towels. Sprinkle with salt and let sit 10 minutes.
3. In a mortar and pestle, mash parsley, garlic, thyme, and 1/8 tsp salt into a paste. Stir in paprika. Add a bit of water if needed to form a paste.
4. Heat 6 tbsp oil in a 15" paella pan over medium-high heat. Quickly brown the fish for 1–2 minutes (do not fully cook). Remove to a warm platter.
5. Add remaining 2 tbsp oil, onion, scallions, and bell pepper to the pan. Cook until slightly softened.
6. Raise heat, add tomato, and cook until sauce-like, 2–5 minutes.
7. Pour in the hot broth and bring to a boil.
8. Sprinkle rice evenly across the pan. Boil 3 minutes, stirring rice and rotating the pan.
9. Add the browned fish (not shrimp). Stir in parsley paste. Taste for salt. **Do not stir from this point forward.**
10. Lower heat and simmer until rice is no longer soupy but still has enough liquid to continue cooking (about 10 minutes). Add extra liquid if necessary.
11. Arrange shrimp, clams, and mussels on top of the rice, placing them so shells open facing upward.
12. Cook uncovered for 15–20 minutes, until rice is almost done.
13. Remove from heat, cover with foil, and rest 10 minutes.
14. Serve with lemon wedges and fresh alioli.
