## Instructions

- Lightly dust each cube with potato starch. Shake off excess.

### 3. Air Fry Tofu:
- Preheat air fryer to 375°F (190°C).
- Lightly oil or spray the tofu to get a golden crust.
- Air fry for 10–12 minutes, shaking halfway through until golden and crisp.

### 4. Make Sauce:
- In a small saucepan, combine dashi, soy sauce, mirin, and sugar. Simmer for 2–3 minutes. Keep warm.

### 5. Serve:
- Place tofu in a shallow bowl.
- Pour warm sauce over or around the tofu.
- Top with green onions, daikon, bonito flakes, and/or nori.
