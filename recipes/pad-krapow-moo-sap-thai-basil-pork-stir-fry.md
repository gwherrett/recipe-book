# Pad Krapow Moo Sap (Thai Basil Pork Stir-Fry)

**Servings:** 2 to 4  
**Total Time:** ~20 minutes

---

## Ingredients
- ¼ cup vegetable oil  
- 1 pound **ground pork** (with some fat content for flavor)  
- 2 teaspoons minced garlic (about 2 cloves)  
- 2 teaspoons granulated sugar  
- 1 teaspoon minced fresh bird’s-eye chile (or Thai chile to taste)  
- 8 ounces green beans, trimmed and cut into ½-inch pieces (optional but common in modern Thai-American versions)  
- 3 tablespoons oyster sauce  
- 2 tablespoons fish sauce  
- 1 tablespoon **Golden Mountain** or **Maggi** Thai seasoning sauce  
- 1 cup loosely packed **holy basil** (substitute Thai basil if unavailable)  
- Ground white pepper, to taste  
- Steamed **jasmine rice**, for serving  
- 1 crispy fried egg per serving (optional but highly traditional)

---

## Instructions

1. **Sauté the Pork:**  
   Heat a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the vegetable oil. When hot and shimmering, add ground pork and break it up with a spatula. Cook until just browned and slightly crispy at the edges, ~6 minutes.

2. **Build the Aromatic Base:**  
   Add the garlic, sugar, and chile. Stir-fry until fragrant and the garlic is golden, ~1–2 minutes.

3. **Add Green Beans and Sauces:**  
   Add green beans (if using), oyster sauce, fish sauce, and Thai seasoning sauce. Stir constantly until green beans are crisp-tender and pork is fully cooked and glossy, ~2 minutes. Add a splash of water if it starts to look dry.

4. **Add Basil and Pepper:**  
   Remove from heat and stir in the holy basil and a dash of white pepper. Mix until the basil wilts and releases its aroma.

5. **Serve:**  
   Plate over jasmine rice and top with a crispy fried egg. Serve with extra Thai seasoning sauce or fish sauce with sliced chiles (*nam pla prik*) on the side.

## Notes
- **Holy basil** (krapow) gives this dish its name and signature peppery flavor.
- **Ground pork** is the traditional protein — rich, flavorful, and absorbs the sauces well.
- **Fried egg** (*kai dao*) with crispy edges is a beloved pairing in Thai street food.
