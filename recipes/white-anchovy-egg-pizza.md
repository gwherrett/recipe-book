# White Anchovy & Egg Pizza

**Category:** Pizza / Mains  
**Tags:** boquerones, eggs, weeknight, seafood, Italian-inspired  
**Yield:** 1 × 12–14 in (30–35 cm) pizza (2–3 servings)  
**Time:** 20 min prep · 45–60 min preheat · 6–10 min bake

## Summary
A bright, briny white pizza that pairs silky eggs with tangy *boquerones* (vinegar‑marinated white anchovies). A garlic–olive‑oil base and a little crème fraîche keep it creamy without overpowering the fish. Finish with lemon and herbs for lift.

## Ingredients
### Base
- 250–300 g pizza dough (for a 12–14 in / 30–35 cm round)  
- 2 tbsp extra‑virgin olive oil, divided
- 1 small garlic clove, finely grated (or ½ tsp garlic paste)
- 3–4 tbsp (45–60 g) crème fraîche **or** mascarpone **or** ricotta (loosen with a splash of water if thick)

### Cheese & toppings
- 125 g fresh mozzarella, well‑dried and torn **or** 100 g low‑moisture mozzarella, grated
- 60–90 g white anchovies (*boquerones*), drained
- 1–2 tsp small capers, drained (optional but lovely)
- A few very thin slices red onion or shallot (optional)
- ¼ tsp crushed red pepper flakes (optional)
- 2 large eggs
- Fine sea salt & freshly ground black pepper

### Finish
- Zest of ½ lemon, plus lemon wedges for serving
- A small handful flat‑leaf parsley, dill, or chives, chopped
- Extra olive oil, for drizzling

## Method
1. **Preheat.** Place a pizza stone/steel on the top rack and heat the oven to its hottest setting (260–290°C / 500–550°F) for 45–60 minutes. For a sheet pan, place the pan in the oven while preheating.
2. **Make the white base.** In a small bowl, mix 1 tbsp olive oil with the grated garlic and crème fraîche until smooth.
3. **Stretch the dough.** On a lightly floured surface, shape the dough into a 12–14 in (30–35 cm) round. Transfer to a floured peel or the back of a sheet pan lined with parchment.
4. **Assemble.** Spread the white base thinly, leaving a small border. Scatter mozzarella evenly. Add capers and a few onion slivers if using. Season with a little black pepper (go easy on salt—anchovies are seasoned).
5. **Bake & add eggs.** Slide the pizza onto the stone/steel. Bake 3–4 minutes until the cheese just begins to melt. Pull the pizza, quickly crack 2 eggs onto the surface (make small “wells” in the cheese if helpful), then return to the oven and bake 3–5 minutes more, until the whites are set and the yolks are still runny (or to your preferred doneness). For a sheet pan, total time may be 8–10 minutes.
6. **Finish.** Top with white anchovies (distribute gently so they stay whole), lemon zest, herbs, and a drizzle of olive oil. Add a pinch of chili flakes if you like heat. Serve immediately with lemon wedges.

## Notes & Tips
- **Anchovy timing:** Adding *boquerones* after baking preserves their delicate texture and bright vinegar cure. If you prefer them warm, add for the final 60–90 seconds.
- **Cheese moisture:** Pat fresh mozzarella dry to avoid sogginess; low‑moisture mozzarella browns more easily.
- **Egg control:** For firmer yolks, crack eggs from the start and bake the full time; for runnier, add in the last 2–3 minutes.
- **Pan method:** Oil a preheated sheet pan, lay the stretched dough, top, and bake on the lower‑middle rack.

## Substitutions & Variations
- **No crème fraîche?** Use 60 g ricotta loosened with 1–2 tsp water and 1 tsp lemon juice; or 2 tbsp mascarpone.
- **Herb swap:** Dill sings with fish; parsley or chives are great. A few fennel fronds work too.
- **Add‑ons:** Paper‑thin zucchini, shaved asparagus, or a few olives pair well. Keep it light.
- **Classic anchovies:** If using salt‑packed/brown anchovies, use fewer (6–8 fillets), rinse, and add *before* baking to mellow.

## Sourcing
Look for white anchovies (*boquerones*) packed in olive oil and vinegar in the refrigerated seafood case of Italian/Spanish grocers, good delis, or specialty markets. Drain well before using.
