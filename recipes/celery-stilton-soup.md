# Classic Celery & Stilton Soup

A traditional British soup that’s creamy, comforting, and full of the bold flavor of Stilton cheese.

## Ingredients (Serves 4)

- 50g (about 3 tbsp) butter  
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped  
- 1 medium potato, peeled and diced  
- 450g celery (about 1 bunch), trimmed and chopped (include some leaves for flavor)  
- 850ml (3½ cups) chicken or vegetable stock  
- 150ml (⅔ cup) whole milk or single cream  
- 150g Stilton cheese, crumbled  
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper  
- Optional garnish: parsley or a swirl of cream  

## Instructions

1. **Sauté the vegetables**  
   In a large saucepan, melt the butter. Add onion, celery, and potato. Sauté gently over low heat for about 10 minutes until softened but not colored.

2. **Simmer**  
   Add the stock. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cook uncovered for 20–25 minutes until the vegetables are very soft.

3. **Blend**  
   Remove from heat and blend the soup until smooth using a stick blender or in batches with a countertop blender. Return to the pan.

4. **Add milk/cream and Stilton**  
   Stir in the milk or cream and the crumbled Stilton. Gently reheat (do not boil) until the cheese is melted and the soup is heated through.

5. **Season and serve**  
   Taste, then add salt and pepper as needed. Serve hot with crusty bread, optionally garnished with parsley or a swirl of cream.
