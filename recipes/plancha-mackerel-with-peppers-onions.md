## Servings
2–3

## Time
Prep: 10 min · Cook: 12–15 min · Total: ~25 min

## Equipment
- Plancha (flat griddle) or heavy stainless/cast-iron skillet  
- Fish spatula  
- Mixing bowl & tongs

## Ingredients
- 2–3 whole mackerel, filleted (about 500–700 g total), pin bones removed
- 2 bell peppers (mixed colors), seeded and sliced into 1 cm strips
- 1 large onion (red or yellow), thinly sliced
- 2 tbsp olive oil, plus more for the plancha
- 1 tsp kosher salt, divided (more to taste)
- 1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper, divided
- 1/2 tsp smoked paprika (optional)
- 1 small garlic clove, grated (optional)
- 1 lemon, cut into wedges (for serving)
- Handful fresh parsley or dill, chopped (for garnish)

## Method
1. **Heat the plancha.** Place over medium-high to high heat until very hot (a drop of water should dance and evaporate immediately). Lightly film with olive oil.
2. **Season the veg.** In a bowl, toss peppers and onions with 1 tbsp olive oil, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper, and smoked paprika/garlic if using.
3. **Start the veg.** Spread peppers and onions on the hot plancha in an even layer. Cook 6–8 minutes, tossing occasionally, until softened with charred edges. Scoot to one side to keep warm.
4. **Season the fish.** Pat mackerel dry. Lightly oil the skin. Season both sides with remaining 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper.
5. **Sear skin-side down.** Add a thin film of oil to the open area of the plancha. Lay fillets **skin-side down** and press lightly with the spatula for the first 10–15 seconds to prevent curl. Cook 3–4 minutes until the skin is crisp and the flesh turns opaque 2/3 of the way up.
6. **Finish.** Flip and cook 30–60 seconds more, just until the thickest part flakes but remains juicy. Slide fillets over the peppers & onions for the last 20–30 seconds to mingle juices, if desired.
7. **Serve.** Transfer vegetables to plates, top with mackerel, squeeze lemon over, and shower with herbs.

## Notes & Tips
- **Heat is key:** Plancha should be very hot to crisp the skin; if smoke alarms are sensitive, open a window.
- **Don’t overcook:** Oily fish like mackerel dries quickly after it’s done—pull it early; carryover heat finishes it.
- **Make-ahead:** Slice peppers and onions up to 2 days ahead. Pat fish dry and keep refrigerated; season just before cooking.
- **Substitutions:** Sardines or bluefish work similarly. Swap lemon for sherry vinegar for a Spanish vibe.
- **Serving ideas:** Add boiled baby potatoes, aioli, or crusty bread to catch the juices. A simple tomato salad is great alongside.

## Variations
- **Basque-ish:** Add strips of roasted piquillo peppers and a splash of sherry vinegar at the end.  
- **Chili-lime:** Toss veg with a pinch of chili flakes; finish fish with lime and cilantro.  
- **Olive-caper:** Fold 2 tbsp chopped green olives and 1 tbsp capers through the peppers just before serving.
