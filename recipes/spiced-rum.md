# Spiced Rum

A deeply aromatic homemade spiced rum infusion featuring warm spices, citrus, and ginger. Ready in as little as 48 hours, customizable to taste, and excellent for sipping or cocktails.

## Ingredients

- 1 (750 ml) bottle decent aged rum  
- 1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise  
- 3 whole cloves  
- 1 cinnamon stick, broken into pieces  
- 5 whole allspice berries  
- 5 whole black peppercorns  
- 1/2 piece star anise  
- 1/8 tsp fresh-grated nutmeg  
- 3 quarter-size pieces fresh ginger  
- 2 strips fresh orange zest (3-inch each, white pith removed)

## Method

1. Combine all ingredients in a large jar and seal.  
2. Store in a cool, dark place for 2–4 days, shaking once daily to redistribute the ingredients.  
3. Begin tasting after 48 hours. Adjust spices if needed.  
4. Once the flavor is where you want it (usually not more than 4 days), strain through a fine mesh sieve.  
5. Bottle and store at room temperature.

## Notes
- For a sweeter profile, add 1–2 tsp demerara or turbinado sugar.  
- Strong spices (clove, star anise) intensify quickly—remove earlier if needed.  
- Excellent for rum punch, eggnog, and Old Fashioned variations.
