## Notes

- Vintage recipe from handwritten recipe card
- 1½ squares unsweetened chocolate = about 1.5 oz (42g)
- Double boiler prevents chocolate from scorching
- Can be made ahead and reheated gently in microwave or double boiler
- Add a pinch of espresso powder for deeper chocolate flavor
- For thicker sauce, reduce boiling time; for thinner sauce, add a little more water
