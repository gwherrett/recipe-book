**Ingredients:**
- 4 cups fresh or frozen corn kernels
- 2 large potatoes, peeled and diced
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 4 cups chicken or vegetable broth
- 1 cup milk
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup heavy cream (optional for extra creaminess)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Chopped fresh parsley or chives for garnish (optional)

**Method:**
1. In a large pot, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until translucent, about 3–4 minutes.
2. Sprinkle the flour over the onions and butter. Stir well to create a roux, and cook for another 2–3 minutes until light golden.
3. Slowly pour in the broth, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.
4. Add diced potatoes and corn kernels. Simmer for 15–20 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender.
5. For a creamier texture, use an immersion blender to partially blend the soup, leaving some chunks for texture.
6. Stir in the milk and heavy cream (if using). Simmer another 5 minutes.
7. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
8. Serve hot, garnished with parsley or chives.

**Notes:**  
- Substitute part of the milk with coconut milk for a dairy-free variation.  
- Add a pinch of smoked paprika or a few slices of crispy bacon for extra flavor.  
- Keeps up to 3 days refrigerated; reheat gently before serving.
