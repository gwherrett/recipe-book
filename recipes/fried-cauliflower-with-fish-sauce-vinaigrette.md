## Summary
A savory, umami-packed cauliflower dish inspired by David Chang’s *Momofuku*. The cauliflower is roasted or fried until crisp, then tossed in a tangy fish sauce vinaigrette with herbs, chili, and lime. The result is bold, aromatic, and deeply satisfying.

## Ingredients

### Fish Sauce Vinaigrette
- ½ cup fish sauce
- ¼ cup water
- 2 tbsp rice wine vinegar
- Juice of 1 lime
- ¼ cup sugar
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- 1–3 Thai chilis, thinly sliced
- 2 tbsp finely sliced cilantro stems
- ½ cup cilantro leaves
- 3 tbsp chopped mint

### Cauliflower & Garnish
- 4 cups cauliflower florets (1 head)
- Neutral oil (grapeseed or similar) for frying or roasting
- Optional: ½ cup puffed rice tossed with ½ tsp oil and ½ tsp shichimi togarashi
- Optional: fried cilantro leaves for garnish

## Method
1. **Make the vinaigrette:**  
   Combine fish sauce, water, rice vinegar, lime juice, sugar, garlic, and chili. Stir until sugar dissolves. Add cilantro stems and mint. Set aside.

2. **Cook the cauliflower:**  
   - *Roast:* Toss florets with oil, spread on a baking sheet, roast at 400°F (200°C) for 20–25 min until golden.  
   - *Fry:* Heat 1½ inches of oil to 375°F (190°C). Fry florets in batches for 4–5 min until golden. Drain on paper towels.

3. **Optional garnishes:**  
   Toast puffed rice in a dry skillet until crisp and lightly browned. Fry cilantro leaves briefly in hot oil until crisp.

4. **Assemble:**  
   Toss cauliflower with a few tablespoons of vinaigrette to coat. Sprinkle puffed rice and fried cilantro on top. Serve warm.

## Notes
- Adjust fish sauce to taste—brands vary in saltiness.
- Also works with brussels sprouts.
- The vinaigrette keeps for a week refrigerated.
