# Salsa Roja (Mild Red Enchilada Sauce)

A mild, rich red chile sauce perfect for enchiladas, chilaquiles, or braised dishes.

## Ingredients

- 3 dried guajillo chiles, stemmed and seeded  
- 1 dried ancho chile, stemmed and seeded  
- 2 garlic cloves, peeled  
- 1/4 of a white onion  
- 2 medium Roma tomatoes (or 1 cup canned fire-roasted tomatoes)  
- 1/2 tsp Mexican oregano  
- 1/4 tsp ground cumin (optional)  
- 1.5 cups chicken or vegetable broth  
- 1 tbsp neutral oil (like grapeseed or canola)  
- Salt to taste  
- 1/2 tsp sugar (optional, to balance acidity)  

## Instructions

1. **Toast the chiles:** Heat a dry skillet over medium heat. Quickly toast the dried chiles for a few seconds per side until fragrant and pliable. Do not let them burn.  
2. **Soften chiles:** Place toasted chiles in a bowl and cover with hot water. Let soak for about 20 minutes, then drain.
3. **Blend:** In a blender, combine soaked chiles, garlic, onion, tomatoes, oregano, cumin, and 1 cup of broth. Blend until very smooth.
4. **Cook the sauce:** Heat oil in a saucepan over medium. Pour in the sauce (it’ll splatter a bit) and cook for 5–7 minutes, stirring often. Add remaining ½ cup of broth. Simmer gently for another 10 minutes.
5. **Season:** Add salt to taste and a pinch of sugar if it’s too tangy.
