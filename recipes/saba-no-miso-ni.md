# Saba No Miso-ni

## Category
Japanese → Fish

## Summary
A classic Kyoto-style simmered mackerel dish in sweetened miso. Fresh mackerel is briefly seared, then simmered with ginger, sake, and vegetables before finishing in a rich, sweet miso sauce.

## Ingredients
### Mackerel & Vegetables
- 1 whole mackerel, filleted and quartered (450–500 g)
- 1/2 cup sake
- 1 cup water
- 1 tbsp usukuchi shoyu
- 2 tbsp ginger, finely julienned
- 1/2 carrot, thin wide strips
- 1/4 daikon, thin wide strips
- 1 1/2 cups sweetened miso
- 1 bunch scallions, finely chopped (garnish)

### Sweetened Miso
- 200 g white miso (shiro/saikyo)
- 200 g country-style miso (inaka miso)
- 70 g sugar
- 70 ml mirin
- 50 ml sake

## Method
1. **Make sweetened miso:** Combine all sweetened miso ingredients in a nonreactive bowl. Set aside. (Makes more than needed; refrigerate leftovers.)
2. **Sear the skin:** Broil or torch the skin side of mackerel until lightly seared without cooking the flesh.
3. **Layer in pan:** Place mackerel pieces skin-side up in a wide pot without overlapping. Cover with ginger, carrots, and daikon.
4. **Deodorize:** Add sake and bring to a quick boil. Add water, boil again. Add usukuchi shoyu and boil once more.
5. **Simmer in miso:** Add sweetened miso and cover with an otoshi-buta or foil cut to size. When miso boils, reduce heat and simmer ~10 minutes. Add 1–2 tbsp water if sauce thickens too much.
6. **Season & serve:** Adjust with a little usukuchi shoyu if needed. Plate mackerel pieces and top with vegetables and miso sauce. Garnish generously with scallions.

## Notes
- Use the freshest whole mackerel you can find; avoid presalted *shio-saba*.
- Leftover sweetened miso is excellent for sautéing thin pork or chicken.
