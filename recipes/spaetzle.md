# Spaetzle (German Egg Noodles)

**Category:** Pasta & Dumplings  
**Tags:** German, Comfort Food, Side Dish  

---

## Ingredients
- 500 g sifted flour  
- ½ tsp salt  
- 4 eggs  
- 1 cup cold water (approx., adjust for consistency)  
- Olive oil (for tossing)  
- Salt (for boiling water)

---

## Method
1. **Make the batter:**  
   In a large bowl, mix flour and salt. Add eggs and water gradually, stirring vigorously with a wooden spoon until the dough is thick and elastic — it should pull and stretch when lifted.  

2. **Boil water:**  
   Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  

3. **Form the spaetzle:**  
   Using a spaetzle maker, colander, or by hand, press or scrape small portions of the dough into the boiling water.  

4. **Cook:**  
   When the spaetzle floats to the surface, it’s done. Remove with a slotted spoon and transfer to a bowl.  

5. **Finish:**  
   Toss lightly with a drizzle of olive oil to prevent sticking. Serve immediately, or pan-fry in butter for a crisp finish.

## Notes
- The dough should be **thick but not stiff**. Adjust with small amounts of water if needed.  
- Spaetzle pairs beautifully with stews, schnitzel, or simply sautéed onions and butter.
