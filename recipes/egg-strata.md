## Notes

- The overnight refrigeration is essential - allows bread to absorb the custard
- Using old (aged) cheddar provides the best flavor
- The water bath (bain-marie) helps the strata cook evenly and stay moist
- Can add cooked bacon, ham, or sausage for a heartier version
- Add vegetables like spinach, mushrooms, or bell peppers for variation
- Vintage handwritten recipe from Claire Still
- Similar to the "Christmas Morning Wifesaver" but with different spicing
