# Chicken Adobo (Filipino)

**Summary:** A classic Filipino chicken adobo—tender chicken simmered in a tangy-savory soy–vinegar–garlic sauce with peppercorns and bay. Simple, deeply flavorful, and perfect over steamed rice.
**Time:** 55–70 minutes (plus marinating)  
**Serves:** 4–6

## Ingredients
- 2 lb (900 g) chicken pieces (thighs/drumsticks, bone-in skin-on preferred)
- 1/2 cup (125 ml) soy sauce
- 1/2 cup (125 ml) white or cane vinegar
- 1/2 cup (125 ml) water (or low-sodium stock)
- 1 head garlic, peeled and minced (8–10 cloves)
- 1 medium onion, sliced
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 tbsp whole black peppercorns (lightly crushed)
- 1 tbsp brown sugar (optional, to balance acidity)
- 1–2 tbsp neutral oil (for sautéing)
- Salt, to taste
- Sliced green onion or chopped cilantro, for garnish (optional)
- Steamed rice, to serve

## Method
1. **Marinate (30 min–overnight):** In a bowl, combine soy sauce, vinegar, water, garlic, bay leaves, peppercorns, and brown sugar until dissolved. Add chicken and coat well. Cover and refrigerate.
2. **Sauté aromatics:** Heat oil in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion and cook 2–3 minutes until translucent.
3. **Brown chicken:** Remove chicken from the marinade (reserve the liquid). Add chicken to the pot and brown lightly on both sides, ~5–6 minutes total.
4. **Simmer:** Pour in the reserved marinade. Bring to a boil, then reduce to low. Cover and simmer 30–45 minutes until chicken is tender and cooked through.
5. **Reduce sauce (optional):** If the sauce is thin, remove chicken to a plate and simmer the liquid uncovered until glossy and slightly thickened. Return chicken to warm through.
6. **Finish & serve:** Taste and adjust salt (and a pinch of sugar if needed). Serve over steamed rice with green onion or cilantro.

## Notes & Variations
- **Coconut Adobo (Adobo sa Gata):** Stir in 1/2 cup coconut milk during the last 5 minutes for a richer sauce.
- **Tang Adjust:** Use more vinegar (up to 2/3 cup) for a sharper profile, or more soy for saltiness. Brown sugar mellows acidity.
- **Peppercorns:** Lightly crush for more aroma; keep whole for a milder bite.
- **Make-Ahead:** Tastes even better the next day; sauce thickens further on reheating.
- **Protein Swap:** Works well with bone-in pork shoulder (cut into chunks); extend simmer to 60–75 minutes.
