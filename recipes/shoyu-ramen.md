# Easy Shoyu Ramen

A quick, comforting soy sauce–based ramen you can make on a weeknight.

- **Serves:** 2
- **Time:** 20 minutes

## Ingredients
- 2 packets instant ramen noodles (discard seasoning)
- 4 cups chicken or vegetable broth
- 2 tbsp soy sauce (shoyu)
- 1 tbsp mirin *(or 2 tsp rice vinegar + 1/2 tsp sugar)*
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 thumb-sized piece ginger, minced
- 2 eggs *(optional, for soft-boiled)*
- 2 spring onions, thinly sliced
- 1 cup spinach or bok choy
- 1/2 cup sliced mushrooms *(optional)*
- 1 small carrot, julienned *(optional)*
- 1/2 cup canned bamboo shoots *(optional)*

## Instructions
1. **Broth:** In a pot, combine broth, soy sauce, mirin, garlic, and ginger. Bring to a boil, then simmer 5–8 minutes.
2. **Eggs (optional):** Boil eggs 6–7 minutes for jammy yolks; cool in cold water, peel, and halve.
3. **Noodles:** Cook noodles per package (1–3 minutes). Drain.
4. **Assemble:** Divide noodles into 2 bowls. Ladle in hot broth. Add greens, spring onions, mushrooms, carrot, bamboo shoots, and eggs.

## Tips
- Taste the broth and add more soy (salt) or a splash of water to balance.
- Add chili oil, sesame oil, or a knob of butter for richness.
- Protein swap: leftover roast chicken, tofu, or pork slices work great.
