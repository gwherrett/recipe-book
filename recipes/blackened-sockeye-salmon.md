- 2 tbsp olive oil or melted butter  
- Lemon wedges, to serve  

### Blackening Spice Mix

- 1 tsp garlic powder  
- 1 tsp onion powder

## Method
1. **Prep the Salmon:**  
   Pat salmon dry with paper towels — this ensures the spice rub sticks and the crust forms properly.

2. **Mix Spices:**  
   Combine all blackening spices in a small bowl.

3. **Season:**  
   Rub salmon fillets generously on all sides with olive oil or melted butter, then coat with the spice mix.

4. **Cook:**  
   Heat a heavy cast-iron or stainless-steel skillet over medium-high until very hot.  
   Add a drizzle of oil and sear salmon, flesh-side down, for 2–3 minutes until a dark crust forms.  
   Flip and cook another 2–3 minutes, depending on thickness, until just opaque in the center (internal temperature ~125 °F / 52 °C for medium).

5. **Serve:**  
   Rest for 1–2 minutes, then squeeze lemon juice over top.  
   Serve with herbed rice, roasted carrots, or a fresh chimichurri drizzle.

## Tips
- For a milder crust, reduce cayenne to 1/2 tsp.  
- If grilling, use a well-oiled grate and cook over high heat for 3–4 minutes per side.  
- Pairs beautifully with roasted vegetables, cilantro-lime rice, or a zesty yogurt sauce.
