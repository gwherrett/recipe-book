# Tuscan Panzanella (Traditional Bread Salad)

**Category:** Salads & Bowls  
**Tags:** Italian, vegetarian, summer, bread, tomatoes, basil  

---

## Summary
A rustic Tuscan salad made with stale country bread soaked in tomato juices, olive oil, and vinegar, tossed with ripe summer vegetables. Traditionally made without lettuce, cheese, or meat — just simple, sun-ripe ingredients balanced by acidity and good olive oil.

## Ingredients
- 4 cups **stale Tuscan or country bread**, crusts removed, torn into 1-inch pieces  
- 4 large **ripe tomatoes**, chopped  
- 1 small **red onion**, thinly sliced  
- 1 **cucumber**, peeled and sliced  
- 1 small **clove garlic**, finely minced *(optional)*  
- 1 handful **fresh basil leaves**, torn  
- 1/4 cup **extra-virgin olive oil** *(high quality)*  
- 2 tbsp **red wine vinegar** *(or white wine vinegar)*  
- **Salt and freshly ground black pepper**, to taste

## Method
1. **Soak the bread:** Lightly moisten the bread with cold water for a few seconds (not soggy). Squeeze gently to remove excess moisture and tear into bite-sized chunks.  
2. **Combine vegetables:** In a large bowl, mix tomatoes, cucumber, onion, and garlic. Let sit 10–15 minutes to draw out juices.  
3. **Add bread & basil:** Toss in the bread and basil, mixing well so the bread absorbs the tomato juices.  
4. **Dress & rest:** Add olive oil and vinegar; season with salt and pepper. Toss thoroughly.  
5. **Rest before serving:** Let sit for at least **30 minutes** at room temperature (or up to 2 hours) so the flavors meld. Serve at room temperature.

## Notes
- Classic Tuscan versions avoid cheese, olives, or lettuce — the simplicity highlights the bread, tomatoes, and olive oil.  
- If your bread is very hard, briefly soak it in water, then squeeze out the liquid before adding.  
- Best made with dense, unsalted Tuscan bread or a rustic country loaf.
