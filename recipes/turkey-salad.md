# Turkey Salad with Preserved Lemon  
A bright, citrusy turkey salad designed specifically for meat that’s been cooked into stock. Preserved lemon provides a lively aromatic kick, while herbs and Dijon bring freshness. Excellent stuffed into warm pita with cucumbers or piled onto toasted sourdough with a handful of peppery arugula.

## Ingredients
### Turkey Salad
- 2 cups cooked turkey (from stock), shredded or finely chopped  
- 1 celery stalk, finely diced  
- 1–2 tsp preserved lemon peel, very finely minced  
- 2 tbsp mayonnaise, Greek yogurt, or labneh  
- 1 tsp Dijon mustard  
- 1 tbsp fresh lemon juice  
- 1–2 tbsp chopped parsley or dill  
- Freshly ground black pepper  
- Salt to taste (preserved lemon is salty—taste before adding)

### Serving Options
**Option A: Pita + Cucumber**  
- 2 pita breads, warmed  
- ½ English cucumber, thinly sliced  
- Optional: extra herbs, chili flakes, or a drizzle of olive oil  

**Option B: Sourdough + Arugula**  
- 2 slices sourdough, toasted  
- 1–2 cups arugula  
- Optional: olive oil, cracked pepper, or shaved Parmesan  

## Method
1. **Prepare the preserved lemon.**  
   Remove a piece of peel from the preserved lemon. Rinse briefly to soften the saltiness, then mince very finely until almost paste-like.

2. **Make the salad.**  
   In a medium bowl, combine the turkey, celery, preserved lemon, mayo (or yogurt/labneh), Dijon, lemon juice, and herbs. Mix until well coated.

3. **Adjust seasoning.**  
   Taste and add black pepper. Add salt only if needed—preserved lemon often brings plenty on its own.

4. **Assemble your serving option.**  

   **For Pita + Cucumber:**  
   Warm the pitas. Spread in the turkey salad, tuck in cucumber slices, and add fresh herbs or a drizzle of olive oil if you like.

   **For Sourdough + Arugula:**  
   Pile arugula on warm toasted sourdough, spoon turkey salad on top, and finish with cracked pepper or a few drops of olive oil.

## Notes
- If your turkey is *very* dry, add a teaspoon of olive oil or an extra spoon of yogurt to loosen the salad.  
- Keeps well for 2–3 days in the fridge.
