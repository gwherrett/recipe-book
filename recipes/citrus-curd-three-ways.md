**Category:** Desserts & Spreads  
**Tags:** Lemon, Lime, Orange, Curd, Preserves

## Summary
A bright, buttery citrus curd recipe adaptable for lemon, lime, or orange. Perfect as a filling for tarts, a topping for scones, or layered in parfaits. Each variation balances tartness and sweetness for a smooth, velvety spread.

## Ingredients (Base)
- 3 large eggs
- 1 cup sugar
- 1/2 cup fresh citrus juice (lemon, lime, or orange)
- 2 tsp finely grated citrus zest
- 4 tbsp unsalted butter, cubed

## Method
1. In a medium saucepan, whisk together eggs, sugar, juice, and zest.
2. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until mixture thickens and coats the back of a spoon (about 8–10 minutes). Do not boil.
3. Remove from heat and whisk in butter until melted and smooth.
4. Strain through a fine sieve to remove zest if desired.
5. Cool, then transfer to jars. Refrigerate up to 2 weeks.

## Variations
- **Lemon Curd:** Use fresh lemon juice and zest.
- **Lime Curd:** Use lime juice and zest; reduce sugar slightly for more tang.
- **Orange Curd:** Use orange juice and zest; add a pinch of salt and optional lemon juice for balance.

**Storage:** Keeps refrigerated for up to 2 weeks or frozen for 2 months.
