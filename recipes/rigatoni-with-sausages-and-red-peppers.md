# Rigatoni with Sausages and Red Peppers

**Source:** The Bonnie Stern School of Cooking

The hearty ingredients in this sauce go perfectly with firmer, commercial pasta. Furthermore, the size and shape of rigatoni is similiar to the sausage and pepper pieces in the sauce.

**Yield:** Serves 4 to 6 as a main course

## Ingredients

- 2 lbs (1 kg) Italian sausages (sweet or hot)
- 1/4 cup (50 mL) olive oil
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/4 tsp (1 mL) crushed red chili flakes
- 3 red peppers, peeled, halved, seeded and cut into 1½"/4 cm pieces
- 3 yellow peppers, cut as for red peppers
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 lb (500 g) rigatoni
- 1/4 cup (50 mL) unsalted butter
- 1 cup (250 mL) grated Parmesan (preferably Parmigiano Reggiano)
- 1/4 cup (50 mL) chopped fresh basil or parsley

## Method

1. **Cook sausages:**
   Prick sausages, cover with water, bring to a boil and cook gently 30 minutes. Cool, remove casings and slice on the diagonal into 1½"/1 cm slices. Reserve.

2. **Cook peppers:**
   Heat oil in a large skillet and cook garlic and hot dried chili peppers until fragrant but not brown. Add peppers and cook 10 minutes or until slightly wilted. Add sausages, some salt and pepper and cook about 20 minutes. (This can be done ahead.)

3. **Cook pasta:**
   Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling, salted water until tender but still firm. Drain well.

4. **Combine and serve:**
   In a large flat bowl toss the pasta with butter and sauce. Top with cheese and basil and combine well. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper if necessary.

## Notes

- The recipe code "P5SAUSDL" suggests this is from Bonnie Stern's pasta/sausage collection
- Can prepare the sausage and pepper sauce ahead and reheat when ready to serve
- Use sweet Italian sausage for milder flavor or hot Italian sausage for more heat
- Roasting and peeling peppers adds extra flavor but you can skip peeling if pressed for time
- The shape of rigatoni is perfect for catching the chunky sauce
- Handwritten notes suggest variations: "cool sausage 30-60 min & fridge" and "Do ahead hand Italian"
