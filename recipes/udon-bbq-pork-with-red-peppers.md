# Udon BBQ Pork with Red Peppers

**Category:** Mains → Noodles & Stir-Fries  
**Tags:** pork, udon, red peppers, weeknight, stir-fry  
**Time:** ~25–30 minutes  
**Serves:** 3–4

## Summary
A quick, savory stir-fry of BBQ-marinated pork and sweet red peppers tossed with bouncy udon noodles and a light soy–sesame finish. Perfect for a weeknight.

## Ingredients
- 8 oz (225 g) udon noodles (fresh or frozen preferred)
- 1 lb (450 g) pork tenderloin, very thinly sliced
- 1/4 cup BBQ sauce (your favorite style)
- 2 red bell peppers, seeded and thinly sliced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 cup sliced green onions (scallions), divided
- 2 tbsp neutral oil (vegetable or canola)
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 2 tsp rice vinegar
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes (optional)
- Kosher salt & black pepper, to taste
- Fresh cilantro (optional), for garnish

## Method
1. **Cook noodles:** Bring a pot of water to a boil. Cook udon according to package directions (fresh/frozen usually 1–2 min). Drain and set aside.
2. **Marinate pork:** In a bowl, toss thinly sliced pork with BBQ sauce; let sit 10–15 minutes while you prep everything else.
3. **Stir-fry pork:** Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add pork in a single layer; cook 3–5 minutes until browned and just cooked through. Transfer to a plate.
4. **Cook peppers & aromatics:** Add remaining 1 tbsp oil to the pan. Add red peppers; stir-fry 3–4 minutes until starting to soften and blister. Add garlic; cook 30–60 seconds until fragrant.
5. **Combine:** Return pork (and any juices) to the pan. Add udon noodles, soy sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil, and red pepper flakes. Toss over heat 1–2 minutes until glossy and heated through. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in half the scallions.
6. **Serve:** Plate and garnish with remaining scallions and cilantro if using. Serve immediately.

## Notes & Variations
- **Char the peppers:** Let peppers sit undisturbed 30–45 seconds to develop char before stirring.
- **Protein swap:** Works with chicken thigh, thinly sliced beef, or firm tofu.
- **Greens boost:** Add a handful of baby spinach or shredded napa cabbage in Step 5.
- **Sauce tweak:** For a sweeter glaze, add 1–2 tsp honey; for smokier, a dash of smoked paprika.
- **Make-ahead:** Slice pork partially frozen for paper-thin strips that cook fast.
