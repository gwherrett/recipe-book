# Pecorino Radicchio Cherry Salad

**Category:** Salads & Bowls  
**Tags:** Vegetarian, Summer, No‑cook, Entertaining  
**Time:** 15 minutes  
**Serves:** 4 as a side, 2 as a light main

## Summary
A bright, sweet‑bitter salad of crisp radicchio, juicy cherries, and nutty Pecorino. Balanced with a simple balsamic vinaigrette and optional toasted nuts for crunch.

## Ingredients
- 2 small heads radicchio (about 450–500 g), cored and thinly sliced
- 2 cups (300 g) fresh cherries, pitted and halved
- 1 cup (60–80 g) Pecorino Romano, shaved into ribbons
- 1/4 cup (60 ml) extra‑virgin olive oil
- 2–3 tbsp balsamic vinegar (to taste)
- 1/4 tsp fine sea salt, plus more to taste
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 1/4 cup (30 g) walnuts or almonds, chopped (optional; toast for extra flavor)
- A few fresh mint leaves, finely sliced (optional)

## Method
1. **Prep the base:** Add sliced radicchio to a large bowl. If you prefer less bitterness, soak in ice water for 5 minutes, then spin dry thoroughly.
2. **Add the fruit & cheese:** Add halved cherries and most of the Pecorino (reserve a few shavings for the top).
3. **Make the dressing:** In a small bowl, whisk olive oil, balsamic, salt, and several grinds of pepper until emulsified.
4. **Toss:** Pour dressing over the salad and toss well to coat. Taste and adjust seasoning.
5. **Finish:** Scatter nuts (if using), mint, and remaining Pecorino over the top. Serve immediately.

## Notes
- **Make‑ahead:** Slice radicchio and pit cherries up to 4 hours ahead; keep chilled and dry. Dress just before serving.
- **Substitutions:** Swap Pecorino for Parmigiano‑Reggiano. Try hazelnuts or pistachios instead of walnuts/almonds. A splash of cherry or red‑wine vinegar also works.
- **Add protein:** Prosciutto, grilled chicken, or farro make it a fuller meal.
- **Seasonal twist:** In late summer, add sliced nectarines or plums alongside the cherries.
