**Category:** Mains → Poultry\
**Tags:** Vietnamese, sous vide, chicken wings, lemongrass, lime

## Ingredients

-   1.5 kg chicken wings\
-   67.5 ml soy sauce\
-   45 ml fish sauce\
-   45 ml hoisin sauce\
-   45 ml honey\
-   45 ml lime juice\
-   9 cloves garlic, minced\
-   22.5 ml grated fresh ginger\
-   22.5 ml lemongrass paste (or finely chopped fresh lemongrass)\
-   7.5 ml five-spice powder\
-   3.75 ml black pepper\
-   Fresh cilantro and sliced lime for garnish

## Instructions

1.  Prepare the sous vide water bath and set the temperature to 165°F
    (74°C).\
2.  In a bowl, mix together soy sauce, fish sauce, hoisin sauce, honey,
    lime juice, garlic, ginger, lemongrass, five-spice powder, and black
    pepper.\
3.  Place the chicken wings in a resealable plastic bag and pour in the
    marinade. Remove excess air, seal the bag, and massage to coat the
    wings evenly. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour
    (preferably overnight).\
4.  Place the sealed bag with the wings and marinade into the preheated
    water bath and cook for 2--3 hours.\
5.  After cooking, remove the wings from the bag and preheat a grill or
    broiler to medium-high heat.\
6.  Drain excess liquid and grill or broil wings for 2--3 minutes per
    side until crispy and lightly charred, basting with the remaining
    marinade if desired.\
7.  Garnish with fresh cilantro and lime slices before serving.

**Note:** Cooking in the marinade infuses rich flavor into the meat
while sous vide ensures tender, juicy wings. Perfect balance of savory,
sweet, and aromatic Vietnamese flavor.
