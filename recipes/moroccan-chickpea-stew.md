# Moroccan Chickpea Stew — Tomato-Rich Tagine Style (with Barberries & Dates)

**Category:** Mains → Stews & Curries  
**Tags:** Moroccan, vegetarian, chickpeas, tomato stew, barberries, dates  

## Summary
A richer, deeper, more aromatic version of Moroccan chickpea stew, inspired by tomato-based tagines. Warm spices (cumin, cinnamon, paprika, turmeric) are bloomed with tomato paste to create a savory foundation accented by tart barberries and naturally sweet chopped dates. Thick, hearty, and perfect over couscous or rice.

## Method

1. **Sauté the vegetables**  
   Heat olive oil in a large non-stick pot over medium-high heat.  
   Add onions, celery, pepper, zucchini, and garlic.  
   Cook 4–5 minutes until softened.

2. **Bloom the spices with tomato paste**  
   Push vegetables to the outer edges of the pot.  
   In the center, add tomato paste, the Moroccan spice blend, and a splash of oil.  
   Stir and cook 1–2 minutes until the paste deepens and becomes aromatic.

3. **Simmer the stew**  
   Add sweet potatoes, diced tomatoes, broth, lemon juice, soy sauce/tamari, and black pepper.  
   Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low.  
   Cover and simmer 20 minutes until sweet potatoes are tender.

4. **Finish with sweet–tart balance**  
   Stir in barberries, chopped dates, peanut butter, and cilantro.  
   Simmer uncovered 5–8 minutes to thicken and meld flavors.

5. **Adjust and serve**  
   - More lemon → brightness  
   - More cinnamon → warmth  
   - More paprika → deeper red color  
   - Simmer longer to thicken, add broth to thin  

Serve over couscous, rice, or with crusty bread.

## Notes
- Barberries bring tartness; dates reintroduce the classic Moroccan sweet element.
- Soy sauce adds subtle umami depth without altering the flavor profile.
- Peanut butter enriches the stew with creaminess and body.
