# No-Potato Salmon Chowder

## 🧄 Ingredients:
- 1 tbsp butter or olive oil  
- 1 small onion, finely chopped  
- 2 celery stalks, diced  
- 1 carrot, diced  
- 2 cloves garlic, minced  
- 1 tsp thyme (fresh or dried)  
- 1 bay leaf  
- 3 tbsp flour (for thickening; or cornstarch slurry if gluten-free)  
- 4 cups fish stock, chicken broth, or veggie broth  
- 1 cup corn (frozen or fresh)  
- 1 cup cream or milk (or a mix)  
- 1 tbsp lemon juice or white wine (optional, for brightness)  
- 200–300g (7–10 oz) cooked or raw salmon, flaked or cubed  
- Salt & pepper, to taste  
- Optional: chopped dill or parsley to finish  

## 🥣 Directions:
1. **Sauté aromatics**: In a pot, heat butter or oil over medium. Sauté onion, celery, and carrot until softened (5–7 mins). Add garlic, thyme, and bay leaf, cooking 1 more minute.  
2. **Thicken**: Sprinkle flour over the veg and stir to coat. Cook 1–2 minutes to remove raw flour taste.  
3. **Add broth**: Slowly whisk in broth, stirring well to avoid lumps. Bring to a simmer.  
4. **Add corn & cream**: Stir in corn and cream. Simmer gently for 10–15 minutes until slightly thickened.  
5. **Add salmon**: If raw, gently poach salmon cubes in the simmering soup until just cooked (about 5 mins). If already cooked, stir in at the end to warm.  
6. **Finish**: Remove bay leaf. Stir in lemon juice or white wine if using. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Top with herbs.
