# Baba Ganoush  
*Serves 8*

I like my Baba Ganoush super-smoky, and leave the eggplants on the stovetop for a good ten minutes, but for most people, that’s probably too much. Five or so minutes, until the skin gets a bit charred, is probably right for most “normal” folks. If you have smoked salt, you can use that to give it another hit of smoked flavor, too.

Sometimes I add a pinch of ground cumin. If you do, please just add just a bit. Baba Ganoush shouldn’t taste predominantly of cumin, which can quickly overwhelm.

## **Ingredients**
- 3 medium eggplants  
- 1/2 cup (130g) tahini  
- 1 1/4 tsp coarse salt  
- 3 tbsp freshly squeezed lemon juice  
- 3 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed  
- 1/8 tsp chile powder  
- 1 tbsp olive oil  
- 1/2 bunch flat-leaf parsley or cilantro leaves, picked

## **Instructions**

1. Preheat the oven to **375°F (190°C)**.  
2. Prick the eggplants several times.  
   Char the outside directly on a gas burner, rotating until evenly charred.  
   *If you don’t have a gas stove, char under a broiler—or skip this step.*  
3. Place eggplants on a baking sheet and roast **20–30 minutes**, until completely soft and a paring knife slips in with no resistance.  
4. Remove from oven and let cool.  
5. Split the eggplants and scrape out the pulp.  
   Purée the pulp with all remaining ingredients in a blender or food processor until smooth.  
6. Taste and adjust with more salt or lemon juice as needed.  
7. Serve drizzled with olive oil and herbs, alongside pita, crackers, or baguette.
