# Mango Pudding

**Recipe by:** Catherine Zhang
**Source:** https://zhangcatherine.com/mango-pudding/

A classic Hong Kong dim sum dessert — silky, wobbly, and bursting with fresh mango flavour. Just 5 ingredients and a blender. Traditionally served at yum cha with a drizzle of evaporated milk.

**Servings:** 4
**Prep Time:** 10 minutes
**Chill Time:** 3 hours

## Ingredients

- 2 cups fresh mango flesh (about 2 large mangoes; Alphonso or Kensington Pride recommended)
- ¼ cup granulated sugar
- ½ cup evaporated milk
- 2½ tsp gelatin powder
- 3 tbsp cold water

### To Serve
- Evaporated milk or whipped cream, for drizzling
- Fresh mango pieces

---

## Instructions

1. **Bloom the gelatin.**
   Combine the gelatin powder and cold water in a small bowl. Stir briefly and let sit for 5 minutes until the gelatin absorbs the water and becomes spongy.

2. **Blend the mango.**
   Add the mango flesh to a blender and blend until completely smooth. For an extra silky result, strain the puree through a fine sieve to remove any fibrous bits.

3. **Add sugar and evaporated milk.**
   Add the sugar and evaporated milk to the mango puree in the blender. Pulse until just combined.

4. **Melt the gelatin.**
   Microwave the bloomed gelatin in 10-second bursts, stirring between each, until fully melted and liquid.

5. **Combine.**
   Pour the melted gelatin into the blender and pulse until smooth and fully incorporated.

6. **Pour and set.**
   Divide the mixture evenly among 4 glasses or moulds. Refrigerate for at least 3 hours, or until fully set.

7. **Serve.**
   Drizzle with evaporated milk (traditional) or top with whipped cream. Add fresh mango pieces and serve immediately.

## Notes

- **Best mangoes to use:** Alphonso mangoes give the richest, most intense flavour. Kensington Pride and Honey Gold also work well. Use the ripest, sweetest mangoes available.
- **Silkier texture:** Straining the mango puree through a fine sieve before blending with the other ingredients makes a noticeable difference.
- **Avoid pineapple and kiwi** as substitutes — both contain enzymes that prevent gelatin from setting.
- **Vegan option:** Substitute agar-agar for gelatin (use a smaller amount, as it sets firmer) and coconut milk or whole milk for evaporated milk.
- **Make ahead:** Puddings keep covered in the fridge for up to 4 days. Add toppings just before serving.
