# 🥪 Cuban Sandwich (Cubano)

**Serves:** 4  
**Time:** 20 min prep + 10 min grill  

## Ingredients
- 1 loaf *Cuban bread* (or soft baguette or bolillo)
- 4 tbsp yellow mustard  
- 8 slices Swiss cheese  
- 8 slices *deli ham* (preferably sweet or smoked)
- 8 slices *roast pork* (mojo-marinated pork is ideal – see note below)
- 8–12 dill pickle slices (lengthwise or round)
- 2 tbsp unsalted butter, softened

## Instructions
1. **Preheat press/panini grill** (or a heavy skillet + second pan to press).
2. **Slice the bread** lengthwise. Lightly butter the outside of each half.
3. **Layer inside (bottom-up):**
   - Mustard (both sides)
   - Swiss cheese
   - Pickles
   - Ham
   - Roast pork
   - More cheese (optional for extra melt)
4. **Assemble & press**: Close the sandwich, buttered side out. Press in panini grill or skillet, weighing down with another pan. Grill until golden and cheese melts (~5–7 min).
5. **Slice & serve**: Cut diagonally and enjoy while hot.

## Notes
- **Mojo Pork**: For authentic flavor, use leftover roast pork marinated in **mojo** (garlic, orange juice, lime juice, oregano, cumin).
- **Bread Substitutes**: Cuban bread is ideal, but soft French bread or Italian rolls work well. Avoid crusty artisan loaves.
- **Optional Add-ins**: A few Cubans add a slather of mayo or salami (especially in Tampa), but traditional Miami-style skips both.
