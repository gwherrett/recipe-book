## Ingredients

### For the Noodles and Stir Fry:
- 8 ounces flat rice noodles
- 3 Tablespoons oil
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 8 ounces uncooked shrimp, chicken, or extra-firm tofu, cut into small pieces
- 2 eggs
- 1 cup fresh bean sprouts
- 1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced
- 3 green onions, chopped
- ½ cup dry roasted peanuts
- 2 limes
- ½ cup fresh cilantro, chopped

### For the Pad Thai Sauce:
- 3 Tablespoons fish sauce
- 1 Tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce

- 2 Tablespoons creamy peanut butter (optional)

## Instructions

1. **Cook noodles:**
   Cook noodles according to package instructions, just until tender. Rinse under cold water.

2. **Make sauce:**
   Combine sauce ingredients in a bowl. Set aside.

3. **Stir fry protein:**
   Heat 1½ tablespoons of oil in a wok or large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the shrimp, chicken or tofu, garlic and bell pepper. The shrimp will cook quickly, about 1-2 minutes on each side, or until pink. If using chicken, cook until just cooked through, about 3-4 minutes, flipping only once.

4. **Scramble eggs:**
   Push everything to the side of the pan. Add a little more oil and add the beaten eggs. Scramble the eggs, breaking them into small pieces with a spatula as they cook.

5. **Combine everything:**
   Add noodles, sauce, bean sprouts and peanuts to the wok (reserving some peanuts for topping at the end). Toss everything to combine.

6. **Serve:**
   Garnish the top with green onions, extra peanuts, cilantro and lime wedges. Serve immediately!

## Notes

- **Make Ahead Instructions:** Cut your protein, and chop veggies ahead of time. Stir sauce ingredients together and refrigerate until ready to use.

- **Tamarind Paste:** Substitute 2 Tablespoons Tamarind paste in place of the vinegar, for a more authentic sauce. You can buy tamarind online, or at an international foods market.

- **Vegan or Vegetarian:** Leave out the egg. Use tofu, and substitute the fish sauce for more soy sauce.

- **Peanut Butter:** The recipe adds a big scoop of peanut butter to the sauce because it gives the whole dish an added creaminess and boost of flavor.

- **Gluten-free Adaptations:** Use gluten-free soy sauce.

- **Storage:** Store leftovers in the fridge and enjoy within 2-3 days.

- **Macros Recipe Adaptation:** 1 lb boneless skinless chicken breasts, ¼ cup dry roasted peanuts
