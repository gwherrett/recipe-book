# Lemon Cream  
*Adapted from Pierre Hermé's* **Desserts**

A rich, silky, satiny lemon cream—more luxurious than standard lemon curd thanks to the high‑speed emulsification with butter. Perfect for tart fillings, cakes, pavlovas, roulades, or folding into whipped cream.

## Ingredients
- 1/2 cup sugar  
- Zest of 2 lemons  
- 2 eggs  
- 1/2 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice  
- 5 oz butter, softened but not melting, cut into 1‑inch pieces  

## Steps
1. **Prepare a water bath:**  
   Set a saucepan of water over medium heat to create a gentle simmer. Place a metal mixing bowl on top, ensuring the bottom doesn’t touch the water.  
   Combine sugar and lemon zest with your fingers until fragrant; add to the bowl. Whisk in the eggs and lemon juice.

2. **Cook the base:**  
   Whisk constantly over the simmering water until the mixture thickens and reaches **180°F (82°C)**. Keep whisking to prevent scrambling.

3. **Strain and cool slightly:**  
   Once thick enough to hold tracks from a whisk, remove from heat.  
   Strain into a blender or food processor. Allow to cool to **~140°F (60°C)**.

4. **Emulsify:**  
   Add butter a few pieces at a time and blend on high.  
   After all butter is incorporated, blend 1–2 minutes more until completely smooth and glossy.

5. **Chill:**  
   Transfer the cream to a container and refrigerate for at least **30 minutes** before using.

## Notes
- For tarts, use chilled and set cream for best slice stability.  
- For mousse: fold cooled lemon cream with whipped cream.  
- Keeps 4–5 days refrigerated; freezes well for 1–2 months.
