## Ingredients
- 200 g dry elbow macaroni
- 1 L chicken stock (or water + 2 tsp chicken bouillon powder)
- 150–200 g ham or Spam, thinly sliced (or use Chinese sausage/rotisserie chicken)
- 1 tbsp unsalted butter or neutral oil (optional, for sautéing)
- 2–3 scallions, finely sliced (reserve some for garnish)
- 1 tsp light soy sauce (optional, to taste)
- ¼ tsp white pepper, plus more to finish
- Salt, to taste

### Optional add‑ins

- 1 small tomato, wedges (classic café variation)

- Blanched leafy greens (choy sum, gai lan, or spinach)

## Method
1. **Cook macaroni.** Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Cook macaroni until *al dente* (per package). Drain; rinse briefly under hot water to stop sticking. Set aside.
2. **Warm proteins (optional).** In a saucepan, melt butter or heat oil over medium. Lightly sauté ham/Spam 1–2 minutes to render aroma (or simply warm later in broth).
3. **Make broth.** Add chicken stock to the saucepan and bring to a gentle boil. Stir in soy sauce (if using) and white pepper. Taste and season with salt.
4. **Combine.** Add the cooked macaroni, ham/Spam, and most of the scallions. If using peas/corn or tomato, add now. Simmer 2–3 minutes to heat through.
5. **Serve.** Ladle into bowls. Finish with remaining scallions and a pinch of white pepper. Top with a fried or soft‑boiled egg if you like.

## Notes & Variations
- **Soup base:** Light chicken stock keeps this “breakfast‑friendly.” For richer flavor, add a small piece of ginger and ½ tsp sugar; remove ginger before serving.
- **Café combo:** Common sides are buttered toast or a HK‑style milk tea.
- **Protein swaps:** Shredded chicken, Chinese ham, luncheon meat, or hot dog slices are all authentic café vibes.
- **Make‑ahead:** Keep cooked macaroni separate from broth; combine when reheating to avoid sogginess.

## Scaling
- For each additional serving, add ~80–90 g dry macaroni and ~350–400 ml stock; adjust seasoning to taste.
