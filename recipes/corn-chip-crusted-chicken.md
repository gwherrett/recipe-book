# Air Fryer Corn Chip Crusted Fried Chicken

## Ingredients

### For the Chicken:
- 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 1 cup buttermilk
- 1 tablespoon hot sauce (optional, for a bit of heat)

### For the Corn Chip Crust:
- 2 cups corn chips (like Fritos), crushed into fine crumbs
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon onion powder
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon dried parsley

### For Cooking:
- Olive oil spray

## Instructions

1. **Marinate the Chicken:**
   - In a bowl, combine the buttermilk and hot sauce. Add the chicken breasts, ensuring they are fully submerged. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to overnight for best results.

2. **Prepare the Corn Chip Crust:**
   - In a shallow dish, combine the crushed corn chips, flour, smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, salt, oregano, thyme, and parsley. Mix well to evenly distribute the herbs and spices.

3. **Coat the Chicken:**
   - Remove the chicken breasts from the buttermilk, allowing excess to drip off. Dredge each piece in the corn chip mixture, pressing firmly to ensure the coating sticks well.

4. **Air Fry the Chicken:**
   - Preheat your air fryer to 375°F (190°C) for about 5 minutes.
   - Lightly spray the air fryer basket with olive oil to prevent sticking.
   - Place the coated chicken breasts in the basket in a single layer, making sure they don't touch.
   - Lightly spray the tops of the chicken with olive oil to help with browning.
   - Air fry for 15-20 minutes, flipping halfway through, until the chicken is golden brown and crispy, and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C).

5. **Serve:**
   - Remove the chicken from the air fryer and let it rest for a few minutes before serving. This will help the juices redistribute and keep the chicken moist.

## Tips
- For extra flavor, you can add a tablespoon of grated Parmesan cheese to the corn chip crust mixture.
- Serve with a dipping sauce like ranch, honey mustard, or a spicy mayo for added flavor.
