# Smoked Goose with Geoff’s Poultry Mix

## Cooking Instructions

1. **Prepare the Geese**:  
   - Spatchcock (butterfly) the two geese by removing the backbone and flattening them. Rinse thoroughly and pat dry with paper towels.

2. **Score the Skin**:  
   - Using a sharp knife, gently score the skin of the geese in a crisscross pattern, being careful not to cut into the meat. This helps render the fat and allows the seasoning to adhere better.

3. **Make the Dry Seasoning Mix**:  
   - In a bowl, combine **4 tablespoons Geoff’s Poultry Mix** (sage, thyme, and rosemary), **2 tablespoons Asian soup mix**, **2 teaspoons salt**, and **1 teaspoon black pepper**.

4. **Season the Geese**:  
   - Generously rub each goose with the seasoning blend, ensuring even and thorough coverage.

5. **Dry the Geese Overnight**:  
   - Lay the geese, skin side up, on a wire rack set over a roasting pan. Refrigerate uncovered overnight to allow the seasoning to penetrate and the skin to dry out.

6. **Prepare the Barbecue**:  
   - Place a smoker box filled with soaked wood chips (apple or cherry) over the unlit burners of the gas barbecue.  
   - Preheat the barbecue to **300°F**. Once preheated, maintain the temperature at **250°F** after placing the geese in.  
   - Position the roasting pan beneath the cooler side of the barbecue to catch drippings and prevent flare-ups.

7. **Smoke the Geese**:  
   - Place the geese skin side down on the cooler side of the barbecue and smoke for the first 2 hours to allow the fat to render properly.  
   - Flip the geese skin side up and continue smoking until the internal temperature of the thickest part of the breast reaches **165°F** and the thighs reach **175°F**.  
   - During the last 30 minutes of cooking, move the geese closer to the heat (still skin side up) to crisp the skin. Monitor closely to avoid flare-ups.

8. **Rest, Slice, and Serve**:  
   - Remove the geese from the barbecue and let rest for 20 minutes to allow the juices to redistribute.  
   - Using a cleaver, slice the geese Asian-style into smaller, bite-sized pieces. Serve and enjoy the harmonious blend of classic French and Asian-inspired flavors.
