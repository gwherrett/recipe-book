# Smoked Gouda Mac and Cheese

## Ingredients
- 8 ounces elbow macaroni (or your favorite pasta)
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 cups whole milk (warm)
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika (optional, for extra smokiness)
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 1 1/2 cups smoked gouda cheese, shredded
- 1/2 cup sharp cheddar cheese, shredded (optional, for extra depth)
- 1/4 cup breadcrumbs (optional, for topping)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil or melted butter (optional, for topping)

## Instructions
1. **Cook the Pasta:**  
   Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the macaroni according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.

2. **Make the Roux:**  
   In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook for about 1 minute, stirring constantly, until the mixture turns golden and smooth.

3. **Add the Milk:**  
   Gradually pour in the warm milk, whisking continuously to avoid lumps. Cook for 3-5 minutes, until the mixture thickens slightly.

4. **Season and Add Cheese:**  
   Stir in the garlic powder, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper. Gradually add the shredded smoked gouda and cheddar, stirring until melted and smooth.

5. **Combine Pasta and Sauce:**  
   Add the cooked pasta to the cheese sauce and stir until fully coated.

6. **Optional Breadcrumb Topping:**  
   If you'd like a crispy topping, preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Transfer the mac and cheese to a greased baking dish. Mix the breadcrumbs with olive oil or melted butter, then sprinkle on top. Bake for 15–20 minutes, or until golden and bubbly.

7. **Serve:**  
   Serve hot and enjoy the smoky, creamy goodness!
