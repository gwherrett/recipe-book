## Thai Basil Ground Turkey (Pad Krapow-Style)

Summary: Lean ground turkey stir-fried with garlic, chilies, and Thai basil in a light soy–fish-sauce glaze. 

### Ingredients (Serves 4)

* 500 g lean ground turkey (93%+ lean)
* 2 tbsp neutral oil (canola or vegetable)
* 6 cloves garlic, minced
* 4–6 Thai bird’s-eye chilies, finely chopped
* 1 small red onion or 2 shallots, thinly sliced
* 2 tbsp light soy sauce
* 2 tbsp fish sauce
* 2 tsp oyster sauce (optional)
* 1 tsp brown or palm sugar
* 1 tbsp dark soy sauce (optional, for colour)
* 30–50 ml chicken broth or water
* 150 g Thai basil leaves (or holy basil if available)
* 4 cups cooked jasmine rice
* 4 eggs (fried)
* Lime wedges, cucumber, tomato (optional)

### Method

1. Prepare jasmine rice ahead of time.
2. Heat a wok on high heat. Add oil, then garlic and chilies. Stir-fry 30–45 seconds.
3. Add onion/shallot and stir-fry 1 minute until softened.
4. Add the ground turkey. Break it apart and cook 4–5 minutes until browned.
5. Add soy sauce, fish sauce, oyster sauce (if using), sugar, and dark soy sauce.
6. Add a splash of broth or water and let it reduce 1–2 minutes, scraping up browned bits.
7. Turn off heat and stir in Thai basil until wilted.
8. Fry 4 eggs in a separate pan.
9. Serve the turkey mixture over jasmine rice and top with a fried egg. Add lime or fresh veg if desired.

### Notes

* Holy basil (krapow) is traditional; Thai basil works well.
* Adjust chilies to preference.
* For a lighter version, reduce oil and use smaller portions of rice.
* Served with jasmine rice and a fried egg.
