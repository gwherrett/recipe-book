## Ingredients
- 2 tbsp olive oil or butter  
- 1 small onion, finely chopped  
- 2 cloves garlic, minced  
- 450 g (1 lb) baby spinach  
- 1 tbsp rice flour (or arrowroot starch)  
- 1 cup milk (dairy or unsweetened almond milk)  
- ¼ cup grated Parmesan (optional for dairy-free omit)  
- Salt and pepper, to taste  
- Pinch of nutmeg (optional)  

## Method
1. **Sauté aromatics:** In a large skillet, heat oil or butter over medium heat. Add onion and cook until translucent, 5–6 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook another 30 seconds.
2. **Wilt spinach:** Add spinach in batches, tossing until wilted. Drain excess moisture if necessary.
3. **Make the cream base:** Sprinkle rice flour over the spinach and stir to coat. Slowly pour in the milk, stirring constantly to avoid lumps.
4. **Simmer & thicken:** Cook for 3–5 minutes until mixture thickens to a creamy consistency.
5. **Finish:** Stir in Parmesan (if using), season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg.
6. Serve warm as a side for meats or holiday mains.

## Notes
- For extra richness, substitute half the milk with light cream.  
- Can be made ahead and reheated gently.  
- To make dairy-free, use olive oil and omit cheese.
