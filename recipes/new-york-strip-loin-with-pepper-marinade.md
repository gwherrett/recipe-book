# New York Strip Loin (Bone‑In, Thick-Cut) with Multi‑Pepper Marinade

**Category:** Mains → Grilling & Steaks  
**Tags:** steak, bone‑in strip, grill, cast‑iron, marinade, peppercorn blend  
**Serves:** 4  
**Time:** 10 min prep + 2–8 hr marinate + 20–30 min cook + 10 min rest

## Summary
A thick, bone‑in New York strip (1.5–2 in / 4–5 cm) marinated in a bold multi‑pepper blend for deep, aromatic heat and a lacquered crust. Cook on the grill or in cast‑iron; finishing temps and rest guidance included.

## Ingredients
- 2 bone‑in New York strip steaks (about 16 oz / 450 g each, 1.5–2 in thick)  
- Kosher salt, to taste (about 1¼ tsp per steak, divided)
- 1 tbsp neutral oil (for searing, if pan‑cooking)
- Optional finish: 1 tbsp butter + 1 crushed garlic clove + few thyme sprigs

### Multi‑Pepper Marinade
- 1/4 cup extra‑virgin olive oil  
- 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar  
- 1 tbsp soy sauce  
- 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce  
- 2 garlic cloves, minced  
- 1 tsp coarsely cracked black pepper  
- 1 tsp smoked paprika  
- 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper  
- 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes  
- 1/2 tsp finely ground white pepper  
- 1/2 tsp ground green peppercorns *(optional)*  
- 1/4 tsp crushed pink peppercorns *(optional)*  
- 2 tbsp chopped parsley or cilantro

## Method
1. **Marinate (2–8 hr):** Whisk marinade ingredients. Pat steaks dry. Lightly salt each side (about 1/4 tsp per steak), then coat with marinade. Refrigerate 2–8 hours, flipping once midway. Remove to room temp 30 minutes before cooking; wipe off excess marinade so it doesn’t burn.
2. **Preheat:**  
   - **Grill:** Medium‑high (450°F / 230°C).  
   - **Cast‑iron:** Heat skillet on medium‑high until shimmering; add a thin film of neutral oil.
3. **Season:** Right before cooking, pat dry again and salt lightly (about 1/4 tsp per steak). Pepper is already in the marinade.
4. **Cook (choose one):**  
   - **Grill:** Sear 4–5 min direct heat per side to develop crust, then move to indirect heat and cook 3–6 min more per side until target temp.  
   - **Cast‑iron + Oven (best for thick cuts):** Sear 2–3 min per side and on the fat cap. Add butter, garlic, and thyme; baste 30–45 sec. Transfer skillet to 400°F / 205°C oven 5–8 min, to desired temp.
5. **Temps (pull 5°F / 3°C early):** Rare 120°F (49°C), Med‑rare 130°F (54°C), Medium 140°F (60°C). Use an instant‑read thermometer; steaks will rise during rest.
6. **Rest (10 min):** Transfer to a rack or board; tent loosely with foil.
7. **Serve:** Slice off the bone, cut across the grain into thick slices. Spoon any resting juices over top; finish with chopped herbs if desired.

## Notes & Tips
- **Pepper blend control:** For less heat, halve cayenne and red pepper flakes. For more fragrance, toast whole peppercorns and coarsely crack.  
- **Surface dry = better crust:** After marinating, blot well. Moisture inhibits browning.  
- **Make‑ahead:** Marinade keeps 1 week refrigerated. Steaks can be marinated the night before for maximum flavor.
