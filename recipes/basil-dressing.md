# 🌿 Basil Dressing

A quick and flavorful basil dressing perfect for salads, grain bowls, or grilled vegetables.

## Ingredients
- 1 cup fresh basil leaves (packed)
- 1 small garlic clove
- 2 tbsp lemon juice (or red wine vinegar)
- 1 tsp Dijon mustard (optional for creaminess and tang)
- ¼ cup grated Parmesan (optional for a savory kick)
- ⅓ to ½ cup olive oil (adjust for desired thickness)
- Salt & pepper to taste

## Instructions
1. Add basil, garlic, lemon juice (or vinegar), and mustard to a blender or food processor.
2. Pulse until roughly chopped.
3. Add Parmesan (if using) and slowly stream in olive oil while blending until smooth.
4. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

## Tips
- For a **vegan version**, skip the Parmesan or use nutritional yeast.
- Add a tablespoon of Greek yogurt or avocado for extra creaminess.
- Store in the fridge for up to 3 days (the color may darken slightly over time).
