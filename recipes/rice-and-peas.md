# Rice and Peas (Jamaican Style)

**Category:** Mains / Caribbean  
**Tags:** Jamaican, rice, coconut, kidney beans

## Summary
A classic Jamaican side dish made with red kidney beans (peas), coconut milk, rice, and aromatic herbs and spices. Often served with jerk chicken or curry goat, it's a staple of Sunday dinners across the Caribbean.

## Ingredients
- 1 cup dried kidney beans (or 1 can kidney beans, drained and rinsed)
- 2 cups rice (preferably long grain or jasmine)
- 1 can (400ml) coconut milk
- 2–3 cups water (adjust as needed)
- 3–4 sprigs fresh thyme (or 1 tsp dried thyme)
- 2–3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 1 Scotch bonnet pepper (whole, do not cut)
- 2–3 green onions (scallions), chopped
- 1 tsp allspice (optional)
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Method

### 1. Prepare the Beans (if using dried)
- Soak dried kidney beans overnight. Drain and rinse.
- Cover with water in a pot and bring to a boil.
- Simmer for 1–1.5 hours until tender. Drain, reserving some liquid.

### 2. Cook the Rice and Peas
- In a large pot, combine cooked (or canned) beans, coconut milk, water, thyme, garlic, onion, scallions, Scotch bonnet pepper, and allspice.
- Bring to a boil. Add rice and season with salt and pepper.
- Stir, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20–25 minutes until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed.

### 3. Final Touch
- Remove Scotch bonnet pepper before serving.
- Fluff with a fork.

## Serving Suggestions
- Best served with jerk chicken, curry goat, or fried plantains.
- Leftovers keep well for 2–3 days refrigerated.

## Notes
- For extra flavor, sauté onion, garlic, and scallions in 1 tbsp coconut oil before adding liquid.
- Can substitute pigeon peas or gungo peas for kidney beans in some regional variations.
