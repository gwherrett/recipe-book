# Gnocchi Recipe

## Ingredients (for 4 servings)
- **4 fist-sized Yukon Gold Potatoes**
- **1 1/3 cups of flour** (plus extra for kneading and dusting)
- **2 eggs** (lightly beaten)
- **Salt** (for boiling water)
- **Oil** (optional, for setting gnocchi after cooking)

## Instructions

### 1. Prepare the Potatoes
- Pressure cook the potatoes for 10 minutes or until tender.
- Peel the potatoes and use a ricer to mash them. Let the mashed potatoes cool completely.

### 2. Make the Dough
- Add **1/3 cup of flour per potato** to the cooled potatoes and fluff with a fork or pastry blade.
- Pour in the beaten eggs and mix lightly.
- Sprinkle enough flour over the wet egg mixture to cover it, then fluff again with a pastry blade.
- Gradually add pinches of flour, testing with the **fist squeeze test**: the dough should come away from your hand without sticking.
- Once the dough is soft and pliable, knead and fold it until there are no cracks in the folds.
- Shape the dough into a rectangular block, about the height of your hand, and let it rest in the refrigerator for 20 minutes. Sprinkle flour underneath and on top of the dough before refrigerating.

### 3. Shape the Gnocchi
- Remove the dough from the fridge and cut it into strips the width of your index finger.
- Roll each strip into ropes about the width of your pinky finger, sprinkling flour as needed to prevent sticking.
- Line up the ropes and trim uneven ends. Cut the ropes into pieces about the length of the first knuckle of your pinky finger.
- Lightly flour the cut pieces and roll each one over a gnocchi paddle or fork to create grooves.
- **Freezing Option:** Spread the gnocchi in a single layer on a tray and freeze until solid, then transfer to freezer bags.

### 4. Cook the Gnocchi
- Bring a pot of salted water to a gentle simmer (like poaching an egg).
- Add the gnocchi in batches, being careful not to overcrowd the pot.
- Scoop out the gnocchi as they float to the top and shake off excess water.
- **Optional Setting Step:** Spread the cooked gnocchi on a tray, drizzle lightly with oil, and refrigerate to set.
- Alternatively, transfer the gnocchi directly into your preferred sauce for serving.
