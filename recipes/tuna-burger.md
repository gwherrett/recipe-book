# Tuna Burger

A fresh, Asian-inspired tuna burger with a light, savory depth from soy sauce and green onions. Ground yellowfin tuna stays tender when handled gently—these patties are quick to prepare and work beautifully with wasabi mayo or sriracha mayo as a spread.

## Ingredients

- 1 lb ground yellowfin tuna (or other tuna)
- ½ cup panko breadcrumbs
- 1 egg
- ¼ cup mayonnaise
- 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon wasabi (optional, for heat)
- 2 green onions, finely chopped
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Oil for cooking

### To Serve
- 4 burger buns, toasted
- Lettuce, tomato, avocado, and toppings of your choice

### Wasabi Mayo (optional)
- ½ cup mayonnaise
- 1–2 teaspoons wasabi paste (adjust to taste)
- ½ teaspoon rice vinegar
- ¼ teaspoon soy sauce

## Instructions

1. **Mix the patty base.**
   Combine the tuna, breadcrumbs, egg, mayo, mustard, soy sauce, wasabi (if using), and green onions in a bowl. Mix gently with your hands—don't overwork it or the burgers will be dense.

2. **Form patties.**
   Shape into 4 patties about ¾ inch thick. Season both sides with salt and pepper.

3. **Heat the pan.**
   Heat a thin layer of oil in a skillet over medium-high heat.

4. **Cook.**
   Cook patties 3–4 minutes per side until lightly browned and cooked through (internal temperature 145°F).

5. **Make wasabi mayo (if using).**
   Whisk together mayonnaise, wasabi paste, rice vinegar, and soy sauce until smooth. Adjust wasabi to your heat preference.

6. **Serve.**
   Place on toasted buns with lettuce, tomato, avocado, and your choice of toppings. Spread with wasabi mayo if desired.

## Notes

- Don't compress the patties too much when forming them—keep them light so the texture stays tender.
- If the mixture seems too wet, add a bit more breadcrumbs until it holds together.
- A spritz of lemon juice on top brightens the flavor.
- Wasabi mayo or sriracha mayo works great as a spread.
