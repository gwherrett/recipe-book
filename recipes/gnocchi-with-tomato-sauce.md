# Gnocchi with Tomato Sauce (Carrot & Parsley)

**Category:** Mains → Pasta  
**Tags:** vegetarian, weeknight, Italian  
**Time:** ~20–25 minutes  
**Serves:** 2–3

## Summary
A quick, comforting gnocchi tossed in a bright tomato sauce enriched with grated carrot and finished with fresh parsley. Simple, pantry‑friendly, and weeknight‑fast.

## Ingredients
- 1 lb (450 g) shelf‑stable or fresh gnocchi
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 small carrot, finely grated
- 1 × 14 oz (400 g) can diced tomatoes
- 1 × 6 oz (170 g) can tomato paste
- 1 tsp dried basil
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- Salt and black pepper, to taste
- 2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped (plus extra for garnish)
- Optional: grated Parmesan and/or a few basil leaves for serving

## Method
1. **Cook gnocchi:** Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook gnocchi per package directions until they float and are tender. Drain and set aside.
2. **Build the sauce:** Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and grated carrot; sauté 2 minutes until fragrant and slightly softened.
3. **Tomatoes & seasoning:** Stir in diced tomatoes and tomato paste. Add dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and pepper. Reduce heat to low and simmer 8–10 minutes to meld.
4. **Combine:** Add cooked gnocchi to the skillet and gently toss to coat. Cook 2–3 minutes to heat through.
5. **Finish:** Stir in chopped parsley (reserve a little for garnish). Taste and adjust seasoning.
6. **Serve:** Plate and top with more parsley and, if you like, grated Parmesan and fresh basil.

## Notes
- For a silkier sauce, add a knob of butter or a splash of pasta cooking water before tossing with the gnocchi.
- Add‑ins: a pinch of chili flakes, a handful of spinach, or sautéed mushrooms.
- Make it vegan by skipping the Parmesan or using a vegan alternative.
