# Japanese Curry Powder

A fragrant and mildly spiced curry blend used in Japanese-style curries, fried rice, noodles, and more. Unlike Indian curry powder, it has a slightly sweeter, milder profile with warm spices that balance beautifully with savory dishes. This homemade version lets you customize the flavors to suit your taste.

## Ingredients

- **2 tbsp turmeric powder**  
- **1 tbsp coriander powder**  
- **1 tbsp cumin powder**  
- **1 tbsp fenugreek powder**  
- **1 tsp ground black pepper**  
- **1 tsp ground cinnamon**  
- **1 tsp ground ginger**  
- **1 tsp garlic powder**  
- **1/2 tsp nutmeg powder**  
- **1/2 tsp ground fennel**  
- **1/4 tsp ground cardamom**  
- **1/4 tsp ground cloves**  
- **1 crushed bay leaf**

### Optional Additions

- 1/4 tsp ground star anise  
- 1/4 tsp allspice  
- 1/4 tsp thyme  
- 1/4 tsp sage  
- A pinch of cayenne pepper (for heat)

## Instructions

1. **Toast the spices:**  
   In a dry pan over low heat, toast all the spices except bay leaf for 2–3 minutes until fragrant. Stir continuously to avoid burning.

2. **Grind the spices:**  
   Let spices cool. Grind them into a fine powder using a spice grinder or mortar and pestle.

3. **Mix and store:**  
   Add the crushed bay leaf. Mix well and store in an airtight container in a cool, dry place.

- Keeps well for several months when stored properly.
