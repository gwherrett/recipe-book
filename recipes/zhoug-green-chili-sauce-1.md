## Classic Yemenite-Style Zhoug (No Mint)

**Ingredients:**
- 1 cup fresh cilantro (stems okay)
- 1/2 cup fresh parsley (optional but traditional)
- 3–4 green chilies (jalapeño or serrano), adjust for heat
- 2–3 garlic cloves
- 1/2 tsp ground cumin
- 1/4 tsp ground coriander
- 1/4 tsp ground cardamom (optional)
- Salt to taste (about 1/4–1/2 tsp)
- Juice of 1/2 lemon
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- Optional: 1 tbsp water to adjust texture

**Instructions:**
1. Add everything except oil to a food processor and pulse to combine.
2. Drizzle in oil slowly until it forms a loose, textured paste.
3. Taste and adjust for salt, lemon, or spice.

**Notes:**
- This version is bold, spicy, and herb-forward with no cooling element.
- Ideal with falafel, grilled meats, flatbreads, or eggs.

## Levantine Zhoug (Mint Version)

**Ingredients:**
- 1 cup fresh cilantro (stems okay)
- 1/2 cup fresh mint leaves (no stems)
- 2–3 green chilies (like jalapeño or serrano), seeded for less heat
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1/2 tsp ground cumin
- 1/4 tsp ground coriander
- Salt to taste (start with 1/4 tsp)
- Juice of 1/2 lemon
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- Optional: 1 tbsp water for thinning

**Instructions:**
1. Roughly chop the herbs, chilies, and garlic.
2. Add all ingredients except olive oil to a food processor or blender.
3. Pulse until finely chopped.
4. With motor running, slowly add olive oil until emulsified and sauce-like.
