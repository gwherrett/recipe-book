## Summary
A bright, earthy Jamaican-style curry powder with warm allspice and a hint of heat. Perfect for goat curry, chicken, seafood, or vegetables.

## Yield
About 1/2 cup (8 tbsp / ~80–90 g depending on grind).

## Ingredients
- 2 tbsp ground **turmeric**
- 2 tbsp ground **coriander**
- 1 tbsp ground **cumin**
- 1 tbsp ground **allspice**
- 1 tbsp ground **fenugreek**
- 1 tbsp ground **ginger**
- 1 tsp ground **cinnamon**
- 1 tsp ground **nutmeg**
- 1 tsp ground **black pepper**
- 1/2 tsp ground **cloves**
- 1/2 tsp **cayenne** (optional, to taste)
- *Optional but authentic vibe:* 1 tsp **paprika** for color

> Tip: For maximum aroma, toast whole spices (coriander, cumin, allspice, fenugreek, peppercorns, cloves) for 1–2 minutes in a dry pan, cool, then grind. Add pre-ground turmeric, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cayenne after grinding.

## Method
1. **(Optional) Toast whole spices:** Warm a dry skillet over medium heat. Add whole coriander, cumin, allspice, fenugreek, peppercorns, and cloves. Toast 1–2 minutes until fragrant; do not burn. Cool completely.
2. **Grind:** Use a spice grinder to grind the toasted spices to a fine powder.
3. **Combine:** In a bowl, mix the ground spices with turmeric, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, cayenne, and paprika (if using). Whisk until evenly blended.
4. **Store:** Transfer to an airtight jar. Label with date and name.

## Storage
- Keep in a cool, dark place up to **6 months** for peak flavor.
- Aroma fades with time; make small batches for the freshest results.

## Use It In
- **Jamaican Goat Curry (Instant Pot)** — 1.5–2 tbsp per 2 lb / 900 g meat (bloom in oil first).  
- Curried chickpeas, shrimp, or potatoes; spice rubs; coconut curries.

## Notes & Adjustments
- **Heat:** Increase cayenne or add a **whole Scotch bonnet** to the dish rather than the blend if you want flexible heat control.
- **Color:** Paprika adds color but isn't essential.
- **Allergy watch:** Fenugreek is related to peanuts/legumes (rare sensitivities).
