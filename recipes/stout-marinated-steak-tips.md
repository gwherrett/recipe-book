# Stout-Marinated Steak Tips  
**Category:** Beef & Marinades  
**Source:** [Food Network](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/stout-marinated-steak-tips-recipe-2118535)

## Ingredients
- 1½ to 2 lb (680–900 g) beef sirloin tips, cut into 2-inch chunks  
- 1 bottle (12 oz / 355 ml) stout beer (e.g., Guinness)  
- ¼ cup soy sauce  
- ¼ cup Worcestershire sauce  
- 2 tbsp Dijon mustard  
- 2 tbsp brown sugar  
- 3 cloves garlic, minced  
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped  
- ½ tsp black pepper  
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil (for grilling or pan-searing)

## Method
1. **Marinate:**  
   In a bowl, combine stout, soy sauce, Worcestershire, Dijon mustard, brown sugar, garlic, onion, and pepper. Add beef tips, coating evenly.  
   Cover and refrigerate at least **2 hours (preferably overnight)**.  

2. **Preheat Grill or Pan:**  
   Heat grill to medium-high (or use a heavy skillet with a bit of oil).  

3. **Cook:**  
   Remove beef from marinade and pat lightly dry. Grill or sear about **3–4 minutes per side** for medium-rare, depending on thickness.  

4. **Rest & Serve:**  
   Let rest 5 minutes before serving. Optionally reduce the marinade (boil 5 min) for a sauce.

## Notes
- Works well with **flank, hanger, or flat-iron steak**.  
- Try substituting **porter** or **amber ale** for a milder flavor.  
- Serve with mashed potatoes or grilled vegetables.
