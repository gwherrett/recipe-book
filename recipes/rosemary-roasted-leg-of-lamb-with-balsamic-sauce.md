# Rosemary-Roasted Leg of Lamb with Balsamic Sauce

**Source:** Williams-Sonoma

Marinating the lamb for an extended period of time will help tenderize the meat while infusing it with more flavor. The marinade also creates a delicious exterior on the lamb after roasting.

## Ingredients

### For the Lamb:
- 1 Tbs. kosher salt
- 2 tsp. freshly ground pepper
- 3 Tbs. finely chopped fresh rosemary
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- Finely grated zest of 1 lemon
- 1 Tbs. olive oil
- 1 boneless leg of lamb, 7 to 8 lb., rolled and tied with kitchen string
- 1/2 cup water

### For the Balsamic Sauce:
- 2 shallots, finely minced
- 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar
- 2 cups chicken stock

## Directions

1. **Prepare the marinade:**
   In a small bowl, combine the salt, pepper, rosemary, garlic, lemon zest and olive oil and stir until blended. Coat the lamb evenly with the rosemary mixture, wrap tightly with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to overnight.

2. **Preheat and prepare:**
   Position a rack in the lower third of an oven and preheat to 450°F. Let the lamb stand at room temperature for 45 minutes to 1 hour.

3. **Initial roast:**
   Set the lamb on a rack in a roasting pan and roast for 15 minutes. Using large tongs, turn the lamb over, add the water to the pan and roast for 15 minutes more. Reduce the oven temperature to 350°F. Continue roasting, turning the lamb every 20 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the meat registers 125° to 130°F for very rare to medium-rare, about 1 hour more, or until done to your liking.

4. **Rest the lamb:**
   Transfer the lamb to a carving board, cover loosely with aluminum foil and let rest for 10 minutes before carving.

5. **Make the sauce:**
   Pour any juices from the pan into a bowl. Skim off the fat, reserving 2 Tbs., and set the pan over medium-high heat. Add the reserved fat and the shallots and cook, stirring to scrape up any browned bits from the pan bottom, until the shallots are tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the vinegar and cook, stirring, until it is nearly evaporated, 1 to 2 minutes more. Add the stock, bring to a boil and cook, stirring, until the liquid is reduced by half, 3 to 4 minutes more. Transfer the sauce to a warmed sauceboat.

6. **Serve:**
   Carve the lamb into thin slices and transfer to a warmed platter. Pass the sauce alongside.
