### Main Ingredients:
- **300 grams (2½ cups) paneer** (Indian cottage cheese)
- **7 to 8 cups (200 to 240 grams) palak** (spinach)
- **4 tablespoons oil** (or half oil & half butter)
- **4 green chilies** (deseeded, less spicy kind)
- **1½ cup (180 grams, 2 small) onions** (fine chopped)
- **1 cup (2 small) tomatoes** (deseeded & chopped or pureed)
- **1½ teaspoon ginger garlic paste**
- **1 teaspoon salt** (use as per your taste)
- **16 to 20 cashewnuts**
- **1 to 1½ teaspoon garam masala** (adjust to taste)
- **1 teaspoon kasuri methi** (dried fenugreek leaves, skip if you don't have)
- **½ cup water** (to blend spinach)
- **1½ cup water** (to cook the gravy)
- **6 tablespoons cream** (optional)

### Optional Whole Spices:
- **¼ teaspoon cumin seeds** (jeera)
- **4 green cardamoms** (elaichi)
- **2 inch cinnamon** (dalchini)
- **4 cloves** (laung)

## Instructions:

### Preparation:
1. **Prepare the Spinach:**
   Pluck only the young & tender spinach leaves and discard the stems as they may leave a bitter taste. If using baby spinach you can use the stems as well.

2. **Wash the Spinach:**
   Add them to a large pot of water. Rinse them well few times & drain to a colander. Allow the water to drain completely otherwise it will let out lot of moisture while cooking.

3. **Cook the Spinach:**
   Heat half tablespoon oil in a pan. Saute green chilies, cashews and spinach for 3 to 4 mins until the leaves wilt off thoroughly & raw smell of spinach has gone away. (OR another option is to blanch the palak in 4 cups of hot water with ¼ tsp salt for 2 mins. Then immerse in ice cold water. Drain completely.)

4. **Blend the Spinach:**
   Cool this completely. Blend this along with water to a smooth puree. The puree should be smooth and thick. You may add 1 to 2 tbsps more water to help in blending.

### Making Palak Paneer:
1. **Heat Oil and Spices:**
   Heat 1 tablespoon butter and half tablespoon oil to the same pan. Once they melt, add cinnamon, cardamoms, cloves & cumin seeds.

2. **Sauté Onions:**
   When the spices begin to sizzle, add onions and fry till they turn transparent to golden.

3. **Add Ginger Garlic:**
   Next saute ginger garlic paste for 1 to 2 minutes or until you begin to smell it nice.

4. **Cook Tomatoes:**
   Then add tomatoes with salt. Saute until they break down and turn mushy.

5. **Add Garam Masala:**
   Add garam masala & saute until the masala smells good. This may take 2 mins.

6. **Cook the Masala:**
   Pour water and cook covered until onions are completely soft. There should be some water left in the pan.

7. **Add Spinach Puree:**
   Lower the flame, add kasuri methi and pureed spinach. Mix well and cook until it begins to bubble for about 2 to 3 mins. If the curry is too thick you may add a few tbsps of hot water.

8. **Add Paneer:**
   Avoid overcooking. Add paneer & mix well. Turn off and remove to a serving bowl. Optionally garnish with cream.

## Serving Suggestion:
Serve palak paneer with **naan**, **roti**, **Basmati rice** or **Jeera rice**.
