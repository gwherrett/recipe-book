# Mexican-Style Pickled Red Onions (Half Batch)

**Category:** Pickles & Condiments  
**Tags:** Mexican, quick pickle, onions, tacos  
**Yield:** ~1 cup

## Summary
Bright, tangy red onions—classic with tacos, cochinita pibil, grilled meats, or bowls. This half-batch version is ready in about 30 minutes and keeps for up to a week in the fridge.

## Ingredients
- 1 medium red onion, thinly sliced
- 1/4 cup fresh lime juice (about 2 limes)
- 2 Tbsp white vinegar *(or apple cider vinegar)*
- 1/2 tsp kosher salt
- 1/2 tsp sugar *(optional, balances sharpness)*
- 1/4 tsp dried oregano *(Mexican oregano if available)*
- 1/2 small fresh chili *(habanero or jalapeño), thinly sliced — optional*

## Method
1. **Prep onion (optional mellowing):** Place the sliced onion in a bowl. Pour boiling water over for 15 seconds, drain, and rinse under cold water. This softens bite and sets color.
2. **Make brine:** In a non-reactive bowl or jar, combine lime juice, vinegar, salt, sugar, oregano, and chili (if using). Stir until salt/sugar dissolve.
3. **Combine:** Add onions and toss to coat evenly. Press onions down so they’re submerged.
4. **Quick pickle:** Let sit at room temperature for **30 minutes** (they’ll turn bright pink). Taste and adjust salt or lime.
5. **Store:** Transfer to a jar and refrigerate. Best after a few hours; keeps **up to 1 week**.

## Notes
- **Yucatán-style:** For a sharper citrus profile, omit the vinegar and use 1/3–1/2 cup lime juice total; add thin habanero slices for heat.
- **Add-ins:** A bay leaf or a few peppercorns add subtle depth; a pinch of cumin warms it up.
- **Serving ideas:** Tacos al pastor, cochinita pibil, carnitas, grilled fish, grain bowls, or burgers.
