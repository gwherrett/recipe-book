4. Add the tomatoes (crushing them with your spoon), black beans, corn, and salt.  
5. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to maintain a gentle simmer.

8. Stir in green onions and cilantro just before serving.

## Notes
- For extra heat, add another chipotle or a teaspoon of adobo sauce.
- For a thicker texture, mash a spoonful of beans against the side of the pot while cooking.
