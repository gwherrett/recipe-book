# Grenadian-Style Curried Goat

A rich, fragrant Grenadian curry featuring tender goat (or lamb), caramelized sugar browning, Scotch bonnet heat, and a flavorful ginger-lime marinade. Best served with rice & peas, fried plantains, or cooked yams.

## Ingredients

- **2 lb** fresh goat (or lamb), cut into large pieces, washed  
- **2 tbsp** fresh lime juice  
- **4 tbsp** freshly grated ginger  
- **1 tsp** salt  
- **4 tbsp** vegetable oil (coconut oil preferred)  
- **4 tbsp** white sugar  
- **2** Scotch bonnet or habanero chiles, seeded and minced  
- **6 cloves** garlic, minced  
- **2 cups** chopped onion  
- **1** tomato, peeled, seeded, chopped  
- **3/4 cup** tomato sauce  
- **4 tbsp** imported curry powder  
- **3 tsp** dried thyme (or **4 sprigs** fresh thyme)  
- **1 cup** water, as needed  

## Method

1. **Marinate the Meat**  
   Place goat in a shallow glass dish. Drizzle with lime juice, spread ginger over top, and sprinkle with salt.  
   Cover and refrigerate **4–6 hours**.

2. **Sugar Browning (Caramelization Step)**  
   Heat a large heavy casserole over high heat. Add the oil and sugar and allow the mixture to caramelize.

3. **Brown the Meat**  
   Add the marinated meat.  
   Remove the pan from heat and allow the meat to brown **without stirring for 30 seconds**.  
   Return to heat, stir, and continue browning.

4. **Initial Cook**  
   Reduce heat to medium and cook **10–15 minutes**, turning the meat occasionally.

5. **Add Aromatics**  
   Add chiles, garlic, and onions.  
   Reduce heat to a simmer, cover, and cook **20 minutes**, stirring twice.

6. **Add Remaining Ingredients**  
   Add tomato, tomato sauce, curry powder, thyme, and water (as needed).  
   Cover and simmer **1½–2 hours**, stirring occasionally, until meat is tender.  
   Add additional water if necessary to prevent burning.

## Notes
- Use a **high-quality imported curry powder** for authentic flavor.  
- Coconut oil deepens the traditional Grenadian profile.  
- Heat level can be adjusted by reducing Scotch bonnet peppers.
