## Method

1. **Preheat the oven:**  
   Adjust the rack to the center and heat to **425°F (220°C)**. Place the **butter** in a 10-inch cast-iron skillet and transfer to the oven. Heat until the butter is melted and browned, about **10–20 minutes**.  
   Pour the browned butter into a heatproof cup, leaving **~1 tbsp** in the skillet.

2. **Mix the dry ingredients:**  
   In a large bowl, combine the **cornmeal**, **flour**, **sugar**, **salt**, **baking powder**, and **baking soda**.

3. **Mix the wet ingredients:**  
   In a second bowl, whisk the **eggs**, **sour cream**, and **buttermilk**.  
   Slowly drizzle in the **reserved browned butter** while whisking constantly.

4. **Combine:**  
   Add the wet ingredients to the dry and stir until just combined—do not overmix.

5. **Bake:**  
   Swirl the hot skillet so the butter coats the sides. Spoon in the batter and smooth the top.  
   Bake **20–25 minutes**, until golden and a wooden skewer comes out clean.

6. **Cool & serve:**  
   Let rest **10 minutes**, then serve warm with extra butter and honey.  
   Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
