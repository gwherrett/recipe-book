# Rockfish Teriyaki

**Category:** Fish & Seafood  
**Tags:** Japanese, Weeknight Meal, Pan-Fried  
**Summary:** A simple teriyaki-style rockfish dish with lightly dusted fillets, pan-seared and finished by basting in a glossy homemade teriyaki sauce. The cornstarch coating helps create a delicate crust that absorbs the sauce beautifully.

## Ingredients
- 600–700 g rockfish fillets (about 4 portions)
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 1/4 cup mirin
- 2 tbsp sake (or dry white wine)
- 1 tbsp sugar (or honey)
- 1 tsp grated fresh ginger
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 tsp cornstarch (plus extra for dusting)
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 1–2 tbsp neutral oil (e.g., canola or grapeseed)

## Method
1. **Prepare the sauce:**  
   In a small saucepan, combine soy sauce, mirin, sake, sugar, ginger, and garlic. Bring to a gentle simmer and reduce slightly, about 3–5 minutes.  
   (Optional: for a thicker glaze, stir in 1 tsp cornstarch dissolved in 1 tbsp water at the end.)

2. **Prepare the fish:**  
   Pat the rockfish fillets dry. Season lightly with salt and pepper, then dust both sides with cornstarch, shaking off any excess.

3. **Pan-fry:**  
   Heat oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the fillets and cook for about 3–4 minutes per side until golden and just cooked through.

4. **Baste and finish:**  
   Reduce heat to medium-low. Pour the teriyaki sauce into the pan and spoon it over the fish repeatedly as it bubbles and thickens, about 1–2 minutes. The sauce should glaze the fillets.

5. **Serve:**  
   Plate the fish with steamed rice and vegetables, spooning extra sauce over the top. Garnish with green onions or sesame seeds if desired.

**Notes:**  
- Rockfish works well as a mild, firm substitute for salmon.  
- Avoid overcooking — the fillets should remain moist and flaky.  
- The cornstarch crust helps the sauce cling and creates a light crisp texture.
