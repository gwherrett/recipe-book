- 10–12 fresh jalapeños, sliced into rings (or substitute part with sliced cucumbers or shallots)  
- 1 cup white vinegar  
- 1 cup water  
- ¼ cup fresh lime juice  
- 2 tsp salt  
- 1 tsp sugar (optional, to soften acidity)  
- 3–4 cloves garlic, lightly crushed

## Method

1. **Prepare the vegetables:**  
   Wash jalapeños and slice into rings. (Optional: include thin cucumber slices or shallots for extra texture.)

2. **Make the brine:**  
   In a saucepan, combine vinegar, water, lime juice, salt, sugar, garlic, bay leaves, coriander, and peppercorns.  
   Bring to a gentle boil, stirring until the salt and sugar dissolve.

3. **Pack the jars:**  
   Place sliced jalapeños (and any optional vegetables) into clean jars, leaving about 1 cm (½ inch) headspace.

4. **Pour the hot brine:**  
   Carefully pour brine and aromatics over the vegetables until just covered. Tap the jar gently to release air bubbles.

5. **Cool and store:**  
   Let cool to room temperature, then seal and refrigerate.  
   Flavor develops after 24 hours and peaks around day 3.  

6. **Shelf life:**  
   Keeps up to 1 month in the refrigerator. For longer storage, follow safe water-bath canning methods.
