### Method

1. **Marinate the Fish:**  
   Combine fish sauce, garlic, shallots, sugar, turmeric, and oil in a bowl. Add the fish and mix to coat evenly. Cover and marinate for at least 1 hour (or up to 4 hours in the fridge).

2. **Prepare Noodles and Garnishes:**  
   Cook the rice vermicelli according to package directions. Drain and rinse under cold water. Prepare the herbs, peanuts, and nuoc cham for serving.

3. **Cook the Fish:**  
   Heat oil or oil-butter mix in a skillet over medium heat. Add the fish pieces in a single layer and cook 2–3 minutes per side until golden and just cooked through. Add the dill and green onions in the final minute to wilt and release fragrance.

4. **Assemble:**  
   Serve the fish and herbs over a bed of vermicelli noodles. Garnish with peanuts, herbs, and a squeeze of lime. Drizzle with nuoc cham.

### Notes
- Traditionally cooked at the table in a sizzling pan and served immediately.  
- Dill is used generously in this dish; it’s the defining herb.  
- Pairs beautifully with a crisp white wine or cold beer.
