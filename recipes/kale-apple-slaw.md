### Kale & Apple Slaw with Honey-Mustard Dressing

**Summary:**  
A bright, crunchy slaw that balances earthy kale with crisp apples and a tangy honey-mustard dressing. Perfect as a side for grilled meats, sandwiches, or fall mains.

**Ingredients:**  
- 1 small bunch kale (about 150 g), stems removed and finely shredded  
- 1 medium apple (Granny Smith or Honeycrisp), julienned or thinly sliced  
- 1 small carrot, grated or julienned  
- 2 tbsp toasted sunflower seeds or chopped almonds (optional)  
- 2 tbsp dried cranberries or currants (optional)  

**For the Dressing:**  
- 2 tbsp olive oil  
- 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar  
- 1 tsp Dijon mustard  
- 1 tsp honey (or maple syrup)  
- Salt and black pepper, to taste  

**Method:**  
1. Whisk together olive oil, vinegar, Dijon, honey, salt, and pepper in a small bowl until emulsified.  
2. In a large bowl, combine shredded kale, apple, and carrot.  
3. Pour dressing over and massage into the kale for 1–2 minutes to soften leaves.  
4. Add sunflower seeds and cranberries; toss to coat evenly.  
5. Let sit 10 minutes before serving for best flavor.

**Notes:**  
- Add 1 tbsp Greek yogurt or mayo to the dressing for a creamier version.  
- Keeps up to 2 days refrigerated — great for meal prep.
