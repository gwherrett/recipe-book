# Limoncello Tiramisu

Note: This recipe uses uncooked eggs. If salmonella is a concern, use pasteurized in-shell eggs.

## Ingredients

- 3 large eggs, separated
- 1 cup powdered sugar
- 1 tbsp grated lemon zest (yellow only)
- 2 cups heavy cream
- 1 lb mascarpone cheese
- 1 cup limoncello
- 2 cups milk
- ~5 dozen French-style ladyfinger cookies
- 2–3 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder
- ~1 cup shaved white chocolate

## Method

1. In a stand mixer (whisk attachment) or using a hand mixer, beat egg yolks, powdered sugar, and lemon zest until pale and light, 3–5 minutes. Switch to the paddle attachment and add the cream and mascarpone; beat until fluffy. If using a stand mixer, transfer to a large bowl.

2. In a clean bowl, whip egg whites to stiff peaks. Gently fold them into the mascarpone mixture. Set aside.

3. In a medium bowl, whisk together the limoncello and milk.

4. Quickly dip ladyfingers in the limoncello mixture and line the bottom of a 13×9-inch dish.

5. Spoon half of the mascarpone mixture over the soaked ladyfingers and smooth the top.

6. Add a second layer of soaked ladyfingers, then spread the remaining mascarpone mixture over top.

7. Chill for about 2 hours. Serve within a few hours of assembly. Dust with cocoa powder and top with shaved white chocolate.
