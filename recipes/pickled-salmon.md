# Pickled Salmon

**Category:** Fish & Seafood → Pickles & Cures  
**Tags:** salmon, pickled fish, preserved, brined

## Summary
A traditional pickled salmon preparation using a two-stage process: first a 24-hour rock-salt cure, then a vinegar brine infused with pickling spices, ginger, garlic, lemon, and onion. The result is a bright, lightly spiced cured fish suitable for serving with crackers, rye bread, or as part of a cold appetizer board.

## Method

### Step 1 — Prep & Cure the Salmon  
1. Clean and fillet the salmon. Removing the skin is optional.  
2. Wipe clean with a damp cloth — **do not wash under running water**.  
3. Place salmon pieces in layers in a crock, sprinkling each layer generously with rock salt.  
4. Let sit for **24 hours**.  
5. Remove the salmon and rinse well in fresh water to remove excess salt.

### Step 2 — Prepare the Brine  
1. Combine vinegar, water, pickling spice, garlic, and ginger in a pot.  
2. Bring to a boil; simmer **10 minutes**, then cool completely.  
3. Cut cured salmon into bite-sized pieces.  
4. In a clean jar, alternate layers of salmon, onion slices, and lemon slices.  
5. Pour the cooled brine over the contents to fully submerge.  
6. Seal and let stand **2 days** in the refrigerator before eating.

## Notes
- Keeps refrigerated for 1–2 weeks.  
- Flavour deepens over time; onions and lemons become pleasantly pickled.  
- Optionally add bay leaves, peppercorns, or sliced jalapeño for additional variation.
