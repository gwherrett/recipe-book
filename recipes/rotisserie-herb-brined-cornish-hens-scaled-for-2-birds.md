# Rotisserie Herb-Brined Cornish Hens (Scaled for 2 Birds)

## Ingredients

### Cornish Hens
- 2 Cornish hens (1–2 lbs each; ~1.5 lbs typical)

### Brine
- 1/4 cup table salt  
- 2 tbsp sugar  
- 1 quart water  

*(If you need more to submerge the hens, make additional brine using the same ratio:  
1 quart water : 1/4 cup salt : 2 tbsp sugar.)*

### Herb Rub
- 2 tsp fresh thyme, minced  
- 1 tsp fresh oregano, minced  
- 1 tsp fresh rosemary, minced  
- 1 tsp fresh sage, minced  
- 1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper  
- Zest of 1/2 lemon (~3/4 tsp)  
- 1 clove garlic, minced  
- 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil  

## Method

### 1. Brine the hens
1. Mix salt and sugar into the water until dissolved.  
2. Submerge hens fully in the brine.  
3. Refrigerate **1–4 hours**.

### 2. Prepare the herb rub & hens
1. Combine all herb rub ingredients in a small bowl.  
2. Remove hens from the brine and **pat completely dry**.  
3. Loosen the breast skin gently with your fingers.  
4. Rub a small amount of herb mixture directly onto the breast meat under the skin.  
5. Rub the rest over the skin and inside the cavities.  
6. Truss both hens.  
7. Mount both hens on a **single rotisserie spit**:
   - First bird: **feet-first**  
   - Second bird: **breast-first**, so the backbones face each other  
   - Secure both with spit forks

### 3. Cook the hens *(grill setup intentionally omitted per instruction)*
1. Place the hens on the rotisserie over drip pans.  
2. Cook with the lid closed for **30–45 minutes**, depending on size.  
   - For 1.5 lb hens, expect ~35 minutes.  
3. Begin checking internal temperature at 20 minutes, then every 10 minutes:  
   - **Breast:** 160–165°F  
   - **Thigh:** 170–180°F  
4. Remove from the grill using heat-proof gloves.  
5. Transfer hens to a platter, tent with foil, and rest **15 minutes**.

### 4. Optional: Make a sauce from the drippings
1. If drippings are not burnt, skim off fat and pour into a small saucepan.  
2. Add **1 cup chicken stock** and bring to a simmer.  
3. Add any juices from carving.  
4. Reduce slightly and season to taste.  

### 5. Final prep & serve
1. Halve each hen:  
   - Cut along the backbone  
   - Split through the breast  
2. Serve **½ hen per person**, or a whole hen for hearty appetites.

## Notes
- If using frozen hens, thaw fully before brining.
- Rosemary can overpower—use lightly.
- A sheet pan next to your platter helps catch drips during removal.
- Rotisserie potatoes in the drip pan are highly recommended.
