# Shredded Chicken Enchiladas (Red & Green)

A flexible, crowd‑pleasing pan of enchiladas where half are sauced **rojo** (red) and half **verde** (green). You mentioned you already have **tomatillo (green) sauce**—perfect! Use it as‑is for the green side and make the quick red sauce below.

## Ingredients

### Shredded Chicken
- 2 large **chicken breasts** (or 4 thighs)
- 1/2 **onion**, quartered
- 2 **garlic** cloves, smashed
- 1 tsp **salt**
- Water to cover

### Green (Tomatillo) Sauce
- 2 cups **prepared tomatillo/green enchilada sauce** *(use what you have)*

### Quick Red Enchilada Sauce
- 1 tbsp **olive oil**
- 1/2 **onion**, finely chopped
- 2 **garlic** cloves, minced
- 1 tsp **ground cumin**
- 1 tsp **mild chili powder** or **paprika**
- 1/2 tsp **dried oregano**
- 2 cups **tomato sauce** (or crushed tomatoes, blended smooth)
- **Salt & pepper**, to taste
- Optional: pinch **sugar** or splash **apple cider vinegar** to balance

### To Assemble
- 8–12 **corn tortillas**
- 2 cups **shredded cheese** (Monterey Jack, Oaxaca, or a Jack/Cheddar mix)
- Neutral oil for soft‑frying tortillas
- Toppings: **cilantro**, **sliced avocado**, **lime wedges**, **thinly sliced red onion**, **Mexican crema or sour cream**

## Method

1. **Poach & Shred Chicken**
   1. Add chicken, onion, garlic, salt to a pot; cover with water 2–3 cm above.
   2. Bring to a boil, then simmer gently **15–20 min** until cooked through.
   3. Remove chicken; cool slightly and **shred** with two forks. Reserve 1/2 cup poaching liquid for loosening fillings if needed.

2. **Make the Quick Red Sauce**
   1. Heat oil over medium. Sauté onion **4–5 min** until translucent; add garlic **30 sec**.
   2. Stir in cumin, chili powder/paprika, oregano **30–60 sec** to bloom.
   3. Add tomato sauce; season with salt & pepper. Simmer **8–10 min**. 
   4. Taste and balance with a pinch of sugar or splash of vinegar if desired.

3. **Prep Tortillas**
   - Lightly **pan‑fry** each tortilla in a film of oil **10–15 sec/side** to make pliable, or steam/microwave wrapped in a damp towel.

4. **Assemble**
   1. Heat oven to **375°F / 190°C**.
   2. Divide your baking dish visually in half. Spoon a thin layer of **red sauce** on one side and **green sauce** on the other.
   3. Working one tortilla at a time, **dip** in red *or* green sauce, fill with **shredded chicken** and a bit of **cheese**, **roll**, and place seam‑side down in the matching sauced half of the dish.
   4. Spoon remaining **red** over the red half and **green** over the green half. Top with remaining cheese.

5. **Bake**
   - Bake **18–22 min** until bubbling and lightly golden at the edges.

6. **Serve**
   - Rest 5 minutes. Top with cilantro, crema, onion, avocado, and lime. Serve with rice and beans if you like.

## Notes & Swaps
- **Chicken alternatives:** use rotisserie chicken or leftover roast turkey; skip poaching step.
- **Extra juicy filling:** mix 1/4–1/2 cup green or red sauce into the shredded chicken.
- **Heat level:** add minced jalapeño/serrano to red sauce or a few dashes of hot sauce.
- **Make‑ahead:** assemble, cover, and refrigerate up to **24 hours**; bake 5–10 minutes longer from cold.
- **Gluten‑free:** verify your chili powder and tomato sauce; use 100% corn tortillas.
