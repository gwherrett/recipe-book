## Notes

- Vintage recipe from a handwritten recipe card
- The long beating time (10 minutes) helps incorporate air and create a tender crumb
- Medium sweet sherry works best; cream sherry or Amontillado are good choices
- Can substitute golden cake mix if butter cake mix is unavailable
- The nutmeg complements the sherry beautifully
- This cake is even better the next day after flavors have melded
