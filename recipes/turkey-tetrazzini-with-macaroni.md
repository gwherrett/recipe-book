# Turkey Tetrazzini with Macaroni & Pita Chip Crust

**Source:** Adapted from [Turkey Tetrazzini with Spinach by Sam Hu, Ahead of Thyme](https://www.aheadofthyme.com/turkey-tetrazzini-with-spinach/)

**Total Time:** 1 hour 5 minutes
**Yield:** 9 servings

Creamy leftover turkey tetrazzini with spinach, adapted to use macaroni in place of spaghetti and evaporated milk for a slightly lighter cream sauce. Cheddar is stirred into the sauce for richness, and a crunchy topping of crushed pita chips and Parmesan replaces the classic mozzarella for extra texture and flavour.

## Ingredients

- 500 g (1 lb) dry macaroni
- 3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 1 lb (450 g) white mushrooms, thinly sliced
- 1 cup onion, finely chopped
- 1 tablespoon garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- 2½ cups chicken broth
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice, freshly squeezed
- 2 cups evaporated milk (approximately two 354 ml / 12 oz cans)
- 2 cups fresh baby spinach (about 60 g / 2 oz)
- 1 lb (450 g) shredded cooked turkey (about 3 cups)
- 1 cup (100 g) sharp cheddar cheese, shredded

### Topping

- 1 cup pita chips, roughly crushed
- ½ cup Parmesan cheese, finely grated
- 1 teaspoon fresh parsley, finely chopped (for garnish)

## Directions

1. **Preheat oven** to 350°F (175°C).

2. **Cook the macaroni:** Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium-high heat. Add macaroni and 1 tablespoon olive oil. Cook until al dente, about 8–10 minutes or according to package directions. Drain and rinse under cold water to stop cooking. Set aside.

3. **Sauté mushrooms:** Heat remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat for 2 minutes. Add mushrooms and sauté until golden brown, about 4–5 minutes.

4. **Build the base:** Stir in onion and garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add salt, pepper, and flour. Stir well to combine, about 1 minute.

5. **Add liquid:** Pour in chicken broth and lemon juice and whisk until smooth. The mixture may look clumpy at first.

6. **Make the sauce:** Whisk in evaporated milk and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Stir occasionally and simmer until thickened, about 8–12 minutes — the sauce should coat the back of a spoon. (Evaporated milk thickens more slowly than heavy cream; be patient and stir frequently to prevent scorching.) Remove from heat and stir in shredded cheddar until fully melted and smooth. Stir in spinach until wilted, about 1 minute.

7. **Combine:** Add cooked macaroni and shredded turkey to the sauce. Toss until fully combined and evenly coated.

8. **Assemble:** Transfer the mixture into a 9×13 casserole dish.

9. **Make the topping:** In a small bowl, mix together the crushed pita chips and grated Parmesan. Scatter evenly over the top of the casserole.

10. **Bake:** Lightly grease a large piece of aluminum foil and cover the pan. Bake covered for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake uncovered for another 15 minutes, or until the pita-Parmesan crust is golden and crisp. Optionally, broil on high for 2–3 minutes to deepen the colour.

11. **Rest:** Let the casserole rest for 10 minutes before serving to allow the sauce to set. Garnish with fresh parsley.

## Notes

- **Evaporated milk vs. heavy cream:** Evaporated milk produces a slightly lighter sauce with a subtly sweeter flavour. Stir frequently while simmering to prevent it from scorching on the bottom of the pan.
- **Pita chip topping:** Use plain or lightly salted pita chips for the best result. Crush them coarsely — a few larger pieces add pleasant crunch. The Parmesan melts into the chips and forms a golden, savoury crust.
- **Make ahead:** Assemble up to a day in advance and refrigerate unbaked. Add the pita chip topping just before baking to keep it crisp.
- **Leftovers:** Store in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. Reheat in the oven at 325°F (160°C) covered with foil to prevent the topping from burning.
