# Winter Melon Soup (Cantonese)

**Category:** Soups  
**Tags:** Cantonese, Chinese, light, winter melon, pork ribs, seafood optional

**Summary:**  
A classic Cantonese broth that’s clean, subtly sweet, and refreshing. Tender winter melon turns translucent and silky while pork (or chicken) and dried seafood build depth. Great as a light starter or simple meal with rice.

## Ingredients
- 900 g (2 lb) winter melon, peeled, seeded, cut into 2–3 cm cubes
- 750 g (1.6 lb) pork ribs or lean pork (or use 1 whole chicken carcass/bones)  
- 8–9 cups water (2.0–2.2 L), plus more for blanching
- 3–4 slices fresh ginger
- 3–4 dried shiitake mushrooms, rinsed and soaked until soft, sliced
- 1 tbsp dried shrimp **or** 1 small dried scallop (conpoy), rinsed (optional but traditional)
- 1–2 tsp Shaoxing wine (optional)
- ½–1 tsp fine salt, to taste
- ⅛ tsp ground white pepper, to taste
- 2 scallions, thinly sliced
- Small handful cilantro, roughly chopped (optional)

**Optional Cantonese touches (choose any):**
- 20–30 goji berries (soaked 5 min) for gentle sweetness
- 40 g Chinese/Jinhua ham, slivered, for a savory accent
- 1 ear fresh corn, cut into 3–4 pieces, for HK‑home style

## Method
1. **Blanch the bones (for a clear broth):** Cover pork ribs/bones with cold water in a pot. Bring to a boil; simmer 2 minutes. Drain and rinse bones under warm water to remove scum. Rinse the pot.
2. **Make the broth:** Return blanched bones to the clean pot with 8–9 cups water and ginger slices. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a gentle simmer (barely bubbling). Skim once. Add dried shrimp/conpoy (if using). Simmer 45–60 minutes for flavor.
3. **Prepare add‑ins:** While broth simmers, soak shiitakes 20–30 minutes until soft; slice. Prep winter melon into even cubes.
4. **Cook the melon:** Add winter melon and shiitakes to the broth. (Add corn pieces or goji now if using.) Simmer 12–18 minutes until the melon turns translucent and just tender—don’t overcook.
5. **Season & finish:** Add Shaoxing wine (if using), salt, and white pepper to taste. Remove ginger. Ladle into bowls and top with scallions and cilantro.

## Notes & Variations
- **Seafood style:** Skip pork bones and use 6–7 cups light chicken stock + 200 g shrimp or fish filet pieces; add seafood in the last 2–3 minutes to avoid overcooking.
- **Vegetarian:** Use a kombu‑mushroom broth; increase shiitake and add a small piece of dried kelp (remove before serving).
- **Meatball version:** Add small pork meatballs (seasoned with soy, ginger, white pepper, sesame oil) for a heartier soup.
- **Clarity tip:** Keep the simmer gentle and avoid vigorous boiling after adding winter melon to maintain a clear broth.
- **Serving:** Traditionally served as a first course. Pairs well with steamed rice and simple greens.

**Time:** 1 hr 15 min (mostly simmering)  
**Serves:** 4–6
