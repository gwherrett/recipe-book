# Beyond Meat Dumplings

From Boyle's Bakers, with Lyndsay. Plant-based dumplings using Beyond Meat, seasoned with ginger, garlic, and sesame. Pan-fried until crispy on the bottom, then steamed to finish—served with a simple soy dipping sauce.

## Ingredients

### Dumplings
- 18 dumpling wrappers
- 226g ground Beyond Meat (two patties)
- 1 green onion stalk, finely chopped
- ½ tsp garlic powder
- ½ tsp ground ginger
- ¼ tsp ground white pepper
- ¼ tsp salt (optional—Beyond Meat already contains salt)
- 1½ tsp soy sauce
- ½ tsp sesame oil
- Vegetable oil for frying

### Simple Dumpling Sauce
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tsp rice wine vinegar
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- Splash of chili oil (optional)
- Pinch of garlic and ginger (optional)

## Instructions

1. **Make the filling.**
   In a large bowl, combine the Beyond Meat, green onion, garlic powder, ginger, white pepper, soy sauce, and sesame oil. Mix until well combined.

2. **Fill and fold.**
   Place 1 tbsp of filling in the center of a dumpling wrapper. Wet the edges of the wrapper, then pinch together one end. Form a pleated shape along the edge, or simply pinch along the edge to close. Repeat with remaining wrappers.

3. **Pan-fry.**
   Heat 1 tbsp of vegetable oil in a nonstick pan over medium-high heat. Add the dumplings and allow to brown on the bottom, 2–3 minutes.

4. **Steam to finish.**
   Add ½ to ⅔ cup of water to the pan and cover immediately. Let the dumplings steam until the water has fully evaporated and the bottoms are crispy, about 4–5 minutes more.

5. **Make the dipping sauce.**
   Stir together the soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, sesame oil, and chili oil if using. Add a pinch of garlic and ginger if desired. Serve alongside the dumplings for dipping.

## Notes

- Salt in the filling is optional since Beyond Meat patties are already seasoned—taste the mixture before adding any.
- The dipping sauce scales easily up or down depending on how many people you're feeding.
- For extra crispy bottoms, let the pan get hot before adding the dumplings and don't move them during the browning stage.
