# Classic Sugar Cookie Recipe

## Ingredients
- 2 ¾ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- ½ teaspoon baking powder
- 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
- 1 ½ cups granulated sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- ½ teaspoon almond extract (optional)
- 1–2 tablespoons milk (if needed for dough consistency)

## Instructions

1. **Preheat Oven:**  
   Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.

2. **Mix Dry Ingredients:**  
   In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, and baking powder. Set aside.

3. **Cream Butter and Sugar:**  
   In a large bowl, use a mixer to beat the softened butter and sugar together until light and fluffy (about 2–3 minutes).

4. **Add Wet Ingredients:**  
   Beat in the egg, vanilla extract, and almond extract (if using).

5. **Combine Dry and Wet Ingredients:**  
   Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing just until combined. If the dough is too crumbly, add 1–2 tablespoons of milk.

6. **Shape Cookies:**  
   Roll the dough into balls (about 1 tablespoon each) and place them on the prepared baking sheets, spacing them 2 inches apart. Flatten slightly with your hand or the bottom of a glass.

7. **Bake:**  
   Bake in the preheated oven for 8–10 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden. Be careful not to overbake.

8. **Cool:**  
   Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for 2–3 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.

## Optional Decorations
- Sprinkle with colored sugar or sprinkles before baking.
- Once cooled, decorate with royal icing or a simple glaze made from powdered sugar and milk.
