- The arugula wilts slightly from the heat of the pasta, creating a nice texture contrast
- Reserve pasta water is key - the starch helps create a light sauce
- Can substitute other pasta shapes like linguine or fettuccine
- For extra richness, finish with a drizzle of good quality olive oil and fresh Parmesan
