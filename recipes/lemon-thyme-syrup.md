# Jean-Georges Lemon Thyme Syrup

## Summary
A bright, herbaceous simple syrup inspired by Jean‑Georges—perfect for cocktails, lemonades, and drizzling over cakes or fresh fruit.

## Yield
About 1¼ cups (300 ml)

## Ingredients
- 1 cup (200 g) granulated sugar  
- 1 cup (240 ml) water  
- 1/4 cup (60 ml) fresh lemon juice (about 1–2 lemons)  
- 6–8 fresh thyme sprigs (or 1/4 cup loosely packed thyme leaves)

## Method
1. **Combine:** In a small saucepan, add sugar, water, lemon juice, and thyme.  
2. **Heat:** Bring just to a boil over medium heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves.  
3. **Infuse:** Reduce heat to low and simmer 3–5 minutes. Remove from heat; let steep 15–20 minutes (longer = stronger thyme).  
4. **Strain:** Pass through a fine-mesh sieve into a clean jar; discard solids.  
5. **Store:** Cool completely. Seal and refrigerate.

## Storage
Keeps 2–3 weeks refrigerated. For longer storage, freeze in small portions.

## Uses
- French 75, Tom Collins, or gin & soda (1/2–3/4 oz per drink)  
- Lemonade or iced tea sweetener  
- Drizzle over yogurt, berries, or citrus cakes

## Notes
- For a softer citrus note, add 2 strips of lemon zest during infusion and remove before bottling.  
- For a thicker finish, simmer 8–10 minutes total to reduce slightly.
