# Wine-Braised Lamb Shanks with Herbes de Provence

**Source:** Bon Appétit, March 2004 (via Epicurious.com)

Tender braised lamb shanks with aromatic herbs de Provence, red wine, tomatoes, and vegetables. If an herbes de Provence blend isn't available, use a combination of dried thyme, basil, savory, and fennel seeds. Dried porcini can be found at Italian markets, specialty foods stores, and many supermarkets.

**Yield:** Makes 6 servings

## Ingredients

- 5 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 2 large leeks (white and pale green parts only), chopped (about 2½ cups)
- 6 large whole garlic cloves
- 6 large lamb shanks (12 to 14 ounces each)
- All purpose flour (for dredging)
- 2⅔ cups dry red wine
- 1 cup canned crushed tomatoes with added puree
- ¼ ounce dried porcini mushrooms
- 1½ tablespoons dried herbes de Provence
- 1¼ pounds slender carrots, peeled, cut diagonally into ½-inch-long pieces
- ½ cup chopped fresh parsley
- Salt and pepper

## Preparation

1. **Sauté aromatics:**
   Heat 1 tablespoon oil in heavy wide pot over medium heat. Add leeks and garlic; sauté until leeks soften, about 5 minutes. Transfer leek mixture to small bowl.

2. **Brown lamb shanks:**
   Sprinkle lamb shanks with salt and pepper; dust with flour to coat. Heat remaining 4 tablespoons oil in same pot over medium-high heat. Add lamb and cook until brown, turning occasionally, about 12 minutes.

3. **Braise:**
   Add leek mixture, wine, tomatoes with puree, mushrooms, herbes de Provence, and carrots. Stir to coat lamb with vegetable mixture. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until lamb is very tender, turning twice, about 1 hour 30 minutes.

4. **Finish sauce:**
   Uncover and continue to simmer until sauce reduces slightly, about 10 minutes longer. Spoon off fat from pan juices. Season lamb to taste with salt and pepper.

5. **Make ahead option:**
   Can be made 1 day ahead. Cool slightly. Chill uncovered until cold, then cover and keep refrigerated. Rewarm, covered, over low heat before serving.

6. **Serve:**
   Sprinkle with parsley and serve.

## Notes

- Can substitute herbes de Provence with: dried thyme, basil, savory, and fennel seeds
- The long braise makes the lamb incredibly tender and falling-off-the-bone
- Porcini mushrooms add deep umami flavor
- Great served with mashed potatoes, polenta, or crusty bread to soak up the sauce
- Recipe from Epicurious.com, originally published in Bon Appétit March 2004
- Wine pairing: Serve with the same type of dry red wine used in cooking
