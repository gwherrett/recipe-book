### Ingredients
- 2 medium Persian cucumbers (or 1 large English), diced small (~300 g / 10 oz)  
- 2 medium ripe tomatoes, seeded and diced small (~300 g / 10 oz)  
- 1/2 small red onion, very finely diced (or 1 small shallot)

### Method
1. Dice cucumbers, tomatoes, and onion into small, even pieces (a fine dice is traditional). Place in a mixing bowl.  
2. Add chopped mint and parsley, if using.  
3. In a small bowl, whisk together lemon juice, olive oil, salt, and pepper.  
4. Pour dressing over the vegetables and toss gently to combine.  
5. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.  
6. Let the salad rest in the refrigerator for 15–30 minutes before serving to allow flavors to meld.  
7. Serve chilled alongside grilled meats, Persian lamb shanks, or rice dishes.

### Notes
- For maximum crunch, seed tomatoes before dicing.  
- Substitute part of the lemon juice with lime for a brighter flavor.  
- Dried mint can be used in place of fresh (use about 1/2 tsp).  
- Keeps 1–2 days refrigerated; best dressed just before serving.

**Pairing suggestion:** Excellent with saffron lamb shanks, chicken kebabs, or tahdig rice.
