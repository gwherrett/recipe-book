## Summary
A deeply aromatic Jamaican goat curry made easy in the Instant Pot.  
Rich coconut gravy infused with scotch bonnet, thyme, and Jamaican curry powder — ready in about an hour.

## Yield
Serves 4–6

## Ingredients
- 2 lb (900 g) **goat meat**, bone-in pieces preferred
- 2 tbsp **Jamaican curry powder** (see [Jamaican Curry Powder](./jamaican-curry-powder.md))
- 1 medium **onion**, chopped
- 3 cloves **garlic**, minced
- 1 tsp **fresh ginger**, minced
- 2 **tomatoes**, chopped (or 3 tbsp tomato paste)
- 2 medium **potatoes**, peeled and cubed
- 1 medium **carrot**, chopped
- 1 **scotch bonnet pepper**, whole (remove later for milder heat)
- 2 cups **coconut milk**
- 1 cup **water** or broth
- 2 tbsp **vegetable oil** or ghee
- 1 tsp **salt**, or to taste
- 1/2 tsp **black pepper**
- 2 sprigs **fresh thyme**
- 2 **green onions**, chopped (optional for garnish)

## Method
1. **Season the meat:** Toss goat pieces with curry powder, salt, and pepper. Marinate 30 min or overnight if possible.
2. **Bloom the curry:** Set Instant Pot to *Sauté*. Add oil and an extra 1 tsp curry powder; cook 30–60 seconds until fragrant.
3. **Sauté aromatics:** Add onion, garlic, and ginger. Cook until translucent, 3–4 minutes.
4. **Brown the goat:** Add the goat pieces in batches and sear lightly for flavor (optional but adds depth).
5. **Add vegetables & liquid:** Stir in tomatoes, potatoes, carrot, scotch bonnet, coconut milk, and water or broth.
6. **Pressure cook:** Cancel *Sauté*. Close lid and set to *Pressure Cook (High)* for **30 minutes**.
7. **Release:** Let pressure release naturally for 10–15 minutes, then quick-release remaining pressure.
8. **Adjust seasoning:** Remove scotch bonnet if desired. Stir in thyme, taste, and adjust salt.
9. **Finish:** Optionally simmer on *Sauté* for 5–10 minutes uncovered to thicken sauce.
10. **Serve:** Garnish with chopped green onion or cilantro. Serve with rice and peas, roti, or fried plantains.

## Tips
- Use bone-in goat for best flavor; lamb or beef can substitute if unavailable.
- Add 1 tsp all-purpose seasoning or browning sauce for richer color.
- For traditional texture, simmer 10–15 minutes after pressure cooking to allow flavors to meld.
