## Instructions

1. **Cook the Potatoes:**  
   Peel and boil the potatoes in salted water until soft (about 20–25 minutes).  
   Drain and mash while warm until smooth and lump-free.

2. **Make the Potato Base:**  
   Mix mashed potatoes with vegetable oil, lime juice, aji amarillo paste, salt, and pepper.  
   Knead until smooth and let cool.

3. **Prepare the Layers:**
   - **Chicken/Tuna Mix:** Combine shredded chicken or tuna with mayonnaise, lime juice, red onion, aji amarillo paste, salt, and pepper.
   - **Cheese and Sausage Mix:** Mix cooked sausage with shredded cheese and cream cheese or mayo until well blended.
   - **Avocado and Tomato Layer:** Slice or mash avocados and toss with lime juice. Prepare tomatoes, seasoned with salt and pepper.

4. **Assemble the Causa:**
   Use a ring mold or small baking dish to layer:
   - Bottom layer: 1/3 of the potato mixture
   - First layer: Chicken or tuna mix
   - Middle layer: 1/3 of the potato mixture
   - Second layer: Cheese and sausage mix
   - Top layer: Remaining potato mixture
   - Final topping: Avocado and tomato layer

5. **Garnish:**  
   Top with slices of boiled egg, black olives, and fresh herbs.

6. **Chill and Serve:**  
   Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before slicing.  
   Serve cold as an appetizer or light main.
