# Slavic Tarragon & Pickle Potato Salad

**Category:** Salads & Sides  
**Tags:** Eastern European, potato salad, pickles, tarragon, yogurt  

## Summary
A classic Eastern European-style potato salad with dill pickles, tarragon, and a creamy-tangy dressing of yogurt and mayonnaise. Inspired by Slavic home cooking, it balances comfort, acidity, and herbal freshness — a perfect side for grilled sausages, schnitzel, or roast chicken.

## Ingredients
- 2 lb (900 g) waxy potatoes (Yukon Gold or similar), scrubbed  
- ½ cup finely chopped dill pickles (or Polish-style gherkins)  
- 1 small red or yellow onion, finely diced  
- 2 green onions, thinly sliced (optional)  
- 2 tbsp fresh tarragon, chopped  
- 2 tbsp fresh parsley or dill, chopped  
- ½ cup plain whole-milk yogurt (or sour cream for a richer Slavic flavor)  
- ¼ cup mayonnaise  
- 1 tbsp Dijon or mild Slavic mustard (like Czech or Polish style)  
- 1–2 tbsp pickle brine or white wine vinegar  
- 1 small clove garlic, finely grated  
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper  
- 2 hard-boiled eggs, chopped (optional but traditional)

## Method
1. **Cook the potatoes:** Place whole potatoes in salted water and simmer until just tender (15–20 min). Drain, cool slightly, peel, and cut into bite-sized pieces.  
2. **Make the dressing:** In a large bowl, whisk together yogurt (or sour cream), mayonnaise, mustard, pickle brine, garlic, salt, and pepper until smooth.  
3. **Combine:** Add warm potatoes to the bowl along with chopped pickles, onion(s), tarragon, and parsley or dill. Toss gently to coat — the warmth helps the potatoes absorb the dressing.  
4. **Add eggs (optional):** Fold in chopped hard-boiled eggs for richness and authenticity.  
5. **Chill:** Refrigerate at least 1 hour before serving. Garnish with extra herbs and a few pickle slices on top.

## Notes
- Use **sour cream** instead of yogurt for a truer Slavic tone.  
- Try adding **a spoonful of horseradish** or **a pinch of sweet paprika** for regional variation.  
- Keeps up to 3 days refrigerated — the flavors deepen as it rests.
