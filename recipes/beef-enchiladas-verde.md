## Ingredients

Serves 4 

### Beef Filling
- 1 lb (450 g) ground beef
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 tsp kosher salt, plus more to taste
- 1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper

### For Assembly
- 8–10 corn tortillas (6-inch)
- 2 cups (475 ml) store‑bought green enchilada sauce (salsa verde style)
- 2 cups (200 g) shredded cheese (Monterey Jack, Oaxaca/Asadero, or a Mexican blend)
- Neutral oil, for softening tortillas (optional)
- Chopped white onion and cilantro, for garnish
- Lime wedges, for serving (optional)

## Instructions

1. **Heat the oven** to 350°F (175°C). Lightly grease a 9×13-inch (23×33 cm) baking dish.

2. **Cook the beef filling:** Set a large skillet over medium heat. Add the ground beef and onion and cook, breaking up the meat, until the beef is browned and the onion is tender, 6–8 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook 30–60 seconds until fragrant. Season with salt and pepper. Drain excess fat if needed.

3. **Warm the tortillas (important):** To prevent cracking, briefly warm tortillas. Either:  
   - **Dry method:** Stack and microwave 20–30 seconds; or  
   - **Oiled method (best texture):** Film a skillet with a little oil and warm each side 10–15 seconds.

4. **Assemble:** Spread 1/2 cup sauce over the bottom of the baking dish. Working one tortilla at a time, lightly dip or brush one side with sauce. Add 2–3 tablespoons beef and a pinch of cheese, roll snugly, and place seam‑side down in the dish. Repeat with remaining tortillas.

5. **Top & bake:** Pour the remaining sauce evenly over the enchiladas and sprinkle with the remaining cheese. Bake, uncovered, until the cheese is melted and bubbly, about 18–22 minutes.

6. **Finish & serve:** Rest 5 minutes. Garnish with chopped onion and cilantro. Serve with lime wedges.

## Notes & Options
- **Cheese:** Monterey Jack melts beautifully; Oaxaca/Asadero is most classic. A little cheddar adds sharpness but will brown faster.  
- **Sauce:** If your store‑bought sauce is very tangy, whisk in 2–3 tbsp crema or sour cream before topping to mellow the acidity.  
- **Make‑ahead:** Assemble up to step 5 and refrigerate (tightly covered) up to 24 hours; bake 5 minutes longer from cold.  
- **Add‑ins:** A small can (4 oz / 115 g) of diced green chiles or 1/2 cup black beans can be folded into the beef.

Enjoy!
