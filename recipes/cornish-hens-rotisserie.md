## Method

1. **Make the brine**  
   Combine water, salt, brown sugar, garlic, herbs, peppercorns, and lemon in a medium pot. Bring to a simmer to dissolve salt and sugar, then cool completely.

2. **Brine the hens**  
   Place the Cornish hens in a large resealable bag or bowl, cover with cooled brine, and refrigerate for **2–4 hours** (no longer than 6 to avoid over-salting).  
   Rinse lightly and pat dry inside and out.

3. **Prep the grill**  
   - Set up your **Weber grill for indirect medium heat (350–375°F / 175–190°C)**.  
   - Place a **drip pan** under the rotisserie to catch juices.  
   - If using charcoal, bank coals on each side of the pan. If using gas, light the outer burners only.

4. **Season the hens**  
   Brush each bird with olive oil or melted butter. Season generously with salt and pepper (plus herbs if desired). Stuff cavities with lemon halves and herb sprigs if you like.

5. **Truss & mount**  
   Tie the legs and wings snugly with butcher’s twine so they spin evenly. Slide onto the rotisserie spit, securing firmly with forks.

6. **Grill-roast**  
   Start the rotisserie motor and close the lid.  
   Roast for **50–60 minutes**, until internal temperature reaches **165°F (74°C)** in the breast and juices run clear.  
   (You can baste once or twice with melted butter or pan drippings.)

7. **Rest & serve**  
   Remove hens from spit and rest 10 minutes before carving. Serve halved or whole with grilled lemon wedges and your favorite sides.

**Tips:**  
- Add a chunk of applewood or cherry wood to coals for a subtle smoke.  
- Brush with a honey–lemon glaze during the last 10 minutes for extra color and flavor.
