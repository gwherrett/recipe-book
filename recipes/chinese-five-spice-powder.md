# Chinese Five Spice Powder

**Category:** Spice Blends\
**Tags:** Chinese, seasoning, aromatic

**Summary:**\
A traditional Chinese spice blend balancing sweet, sour, bitter,
pungent, and salty notes. Perfect for marinades, stir-fries, roasted
meats, or as a dry rub.

## Ingredients:

-   2 tbsp star anise (broken pieces or ground)
-   2 tbsp Sichuan peppercorns
-   1 tbsp fennel seeds
-   1 tbsp whole cloves
-   2 tbsp ground cinnamon or 3-inch cinnamon sticks

## Method:

1.  Toast all whole spices (star anise, peppercorns, fennel seeds,
    cloves, cinnamon sticks if using) in a dry skillet over medium heat
    for 2--3 minutes until fragrant.
2.  Cool slightly, then grind to a fine powder using a spice grinder or
    mortar and pestle.
3.  Sift the powder to remove coarse bits if desired.
4.  Store in an airtight jar for up to 6 months.

**Notes:** - Adjust the ratio to your taste (e.g., more fennel for
sweetness, more peppercorns for spice). - Use 1--2 tsp per pound of meat
for marinades or stir-fries.
