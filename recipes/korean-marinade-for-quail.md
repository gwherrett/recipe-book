# 🐦 Korean Marinade for Quail

A flavorful, well-balanced Korean-style marinade that enhances the rich taste of quail. Ideal for grilling or rotisserie cooking.

## 🧂 Ingredients (for 4 quail)

- 3 tbsp soy sauce  
- 1 tbsp sesame oil  
- 1 tbsp rice wine (mirin or cheongju)  
- 2 tsp sugar or honey  
- 1 tbsp grated Asian pear or apple (for sweetness and tenderizing)  
- 1 tsp grated garlic  
- 1 tsp grated ginger  
- 1 green onion, finely chopped  
- ½ tsp ground black pepper  
- ½ tsp gochugaru (Korean red chili flakes) – optional for heat  
- ½ tsp toasted sesame seeds – optional for garnish  

## 🥣 Instructions

1. Combine all ingredients in a bowl and whisk until well mixed.  
2. Place quail in a zip-top bag or shallow dish. Pour marinade over and turn to coat evenly.  
3. Marinate in the fridge for **at least 2 hours**, ideally overnight.

## 🔥 Cooking Method: Rotisserie (BBQ)

- **Set grill to indirect heat**, with drip pan under the rotisserie.  
- **Preheat to 375–400°F (190–205°C)**.  
- **Cook quail on rotisserie for 18–22 minutes**, lid closed, until internal temp reaches 160–165°F (71–74°C).  
- Let rest 5 minutes before serving.

## ✅ Tips

- Lightly oil the skin before cooking to help crisp and prevent sticking.  
- Brush with reserved marinade or a gochujang glaze in the final 5 minutes for extra flavor.  
- Pair with pickled daikon, sesame spinach, or rice for a full Korean-inspired meal.
