# Cantonese-Style Lo Bak Cake (Turnip Cake)

## Ingredients

- **Rice Flour**: 400g (approx. 4 cups)
- **Cornstarch**: 4 tablespoons
- **Water**: 4½ cups
- **White Radish/Turnip (Lo Bak)**: Approx. 4 lbs to 5 lbs
- **Dried Shrimp**: Soaked and finely chopped
- **Chinese Sausage (Lap Cheong)**: Sliced
- **Dried Shiitake Mushrooms**: Soaked, finely chopped
- **Seasoning**: Salt, sugar, white pepper (to taste)
- **Optional Garnish**: Sesame seeds, green onion

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Turnip**:
   - Peel and shred the white radish (lo bak) into fine pieces.
   - Place shredded radish in a pot and cook with about 2½ cups of water over medium heat for 30–40 minutes, stirring occasionally. The radish should become soft and translucent.

2. **Prepare the Batter**:
   - In a large mixing bowl, combine the rice flour and cornstarch.
   - Gradually add 2 cups of water to the flour mixture, stirring until smooth.

3. **Prepare the Add-ins**:
   - In a pan, sauté the dried shrimp, Chinese sausage, and chopped mushrooms until aromatic.
   - Add the cooked mixture to the radish and stir to incorporate.

4. **Combine Mixture**:
   - Turn off the heat and gradually add the flour mixture into the radish mixture, stirring thoroughly. The texture should be thick but pourable.

5. **Season**:
   - Add salt, sugar, and white pepper to taste. Mix well.

6. **Steam the Cake**:
   - Pour the mixture into a greased or parchment-lined steaming tray.
   - Smooth the surface and steam over high heat for 30–40 minutes. Check doneness with a toothpick – it should come out clean.

7. **Cool and Serve**:
   - Allow the cake to cool completely before slicing.
   - Optional: Pan-fry slices until golden brown for a crispy texture.
   - Garnish with green onions or sesame seeds if desired.
