# Red Lentil Daal (Masoor Dal)

**Category:** Mains → Indian  
**Prep Time:** 10 min  
**Cook Time:** 30–35 min  
**Serves:** 4  

## Ingredients
- 1 cup red lentils (masoor dal), rinsed well  
- 3 cups water or vegetable broth  
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped  
- 2 cloves garlic, minced  
- 1 tbsp fresh ginger, grated  
- 1 medium tomato, chopped (or ½ cup canned diced tomatoes)  
- 1 tsp turmeric powder  
- 1½ tsp ground cumin  
- 1 tsp ground coriander  
- ½ tsp chili powder (optional)  
- 2 tbsp ghee or neutral oil  
- Salt to taste  
- Juice of ½ lemon (optional)  
- Fresh cilantro, chopped (for garnish)

### For the Tadka (Tempered Spices)
- 1 tbsp ghee or oil  
- ½ tsp cumin seeds  
- ½ tsp mustard seeds (optional)  
- 1 dried red chili (optional)  
- A pinch of asafoetida (hing, optional)

## Method
1. **Simmer the Lentils:**  
   In a pot, combine rinsed lentils with water or broth, turmeric, and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer uncovered for about 20–25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until lentils are soft and start to break down.

2. **Prepare the Base:**  
   In a separate pan, heat 2 tbsp ghee or oil. Add onion and sauté until golden (about 8 minutes). Stir in garlic and ginger, cooking 1–2 minutes until fragrant.

3. **Add Tomatoes & Spices:**  
   Add chopped tomatoes, cumin, coriander, and chili powder. Cook until tomatoes soften and the mixture thickens (5–7 minutes).

4. **Combine:**  
   Stir the tomato-onion masala into the cooked lentils. Add a bit of water if you want a thinner consistency. Simmer 5 more minutes to meld flavors. Taste and adjust salt.

5. **Make the Tadka:**  
   In a small pan, heat 1 tbsp ghee or oil. Add cumin seeds, mustard seeds, dried chili, and asafoetida. Let them crackle for 30 seconds, then pour the hot tadka over the daal.

6. **Finish & Serve:**  
   Stir in lemon juice (optional) and garnish with chopped cilantro. Serve with basmati rice or warm naan.
