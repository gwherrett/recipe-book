# Avgolemono (Greek Lemon Chicken Soup)

A silky, tangy Greek classic where eggs and lemon gently thicken chicken broth into a comforting, pantry‑friendly soup.

## Ingredients

**Broth & Chicken**
- 6 cups (1.4 L) low‑sodium chicken stock
- 1 lb (450 g) boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs
- 1 small onion, halved (optional)
- 1 bay leaf (optional)
- 1 tsp kosher salt, plus more to taste

**Starch (choose one)**
- 2/3 cup (120 g) orzo **or**
- 1/2 cup (95 g) long‑grain rice

**Egg–Lemon Mixture (Avgolemono)**
- 3 large eggs
- 1/3–1/2 cup (80–120 ml) fresh lemon juice (about 2–3 lemons), to taste
- Zest of 1 lemon (optional, for extra brightness)

**Finish**
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 2 tbsp finely chopped dill or parsley (optional)
- Extra lemon wedges, to serve

## Method

1. **Simmer the chicken.** In a medium pot, combine stock, chicken, onion, bay leaf, and salt. Bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat; cook 15–20 minutes until the chicken is just cooked through.
2. **Shred and strain.** Remove chicken to a board and shred. Discard onion and bay leaf. Keep the broth at a gentle simmer.
3. **Cook the starch.** Add orzo (10–11 min) or rice (12–15 min) to the simmering broth and cook until tender.
4. **Make avgolemono.** In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs until frothy (30–45 seconds). Whisk in lemon juice (and zest, if using).
5. **Temper.** While whisking constantly, slowly ladle in 2–3 ladles (about 1–1.5 cups / 240–360 ml) of hot broth into the egg mixture to warm it without scrambling.
6. **Finish the soup.** Reduce the pot to **low** heat. Slowly pour the tempered egg‑lemon mixture back into the pot, stirring gently. Add the shredded chicken. Heat gently 2–3 minutes **without boiling** until slightly thickened and silky.
7. **Season & serve.** Adjust salt and lemon to taste. Grind in pepper, stir in dill/parsley, and serve with lemon wedges.

## Notes & Tips

- **Don’t boil after eggs go in.** Boiling can curdle the eggs. Keep it below a simmer to stay glossy and smooth.
- **Thickness control.** More lemon juice brightens; more orzo/rice thickens. For extra body, whisk 1 additional egg yolk into the avgolemono.
- **Chicken options.** Poached thighs yield richer flavor; a rotisserie chicken shortcut works—just use 6 cups good quality stock and skip the poaching step.
- **Silky texture hack.** Use an immersion blender for 5–10 seconds before adding the egg mixture if you want an ultra‑smooth base (do this **before** tempering).

## Variations

- **Lemony Avgolemono Soup (no chicken):** Use vegetable stock and omit chicken for a vegetarian version; add chickpeas for protein.
- **Avgolemono with Greens:** Stir in 2 cups (60 g) chopped baby spinach at the end until just wilted.
- **Pearl Barley Avgolemono:** Sub 1/2 cup (95 g) pearl barley; simmer 25–30 min before tempering.

## Make‑Ahead & Storage

- **Make‑ahead:** Cook broth/chicken and starch separately. Cool, then refrigerate up to 3 days. Reheat broth to steaming, then temper in the fresh egg‑lemon mixture just before serving.
- **Leftovers:** Store up to 2 days; reheat **gently** below a simmer. If it thickens, loosen with a splash of warm stock or water.
- **Freezing:** Not ideal once eggs are added. Freeze the broth/chicken base only; add the avgolemono when serving.

## Serving Ideas

Crusty bread or a simple cucumber‑tomato salad make a perfect pairing. Add a few Kalamata olives for a classic Greek table vibe.
