## 👩‍🍳 Instructions

1. **Marinate the Shrimp**  
   In a bowl, combine shrimp with Shaoxing wine, cornstarch, salt, and egg white. Mix well and set aside for 10–15 minutes.

2. **Prepare Sauce Mixture**  
   In a separate bowl, mix together tomato paste, canned tomatoes, ketchup, oyster sauce, sugar, soy sauce, and vinegar.

3. **Cook Shrimp**  
   Heat oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Add shrimp and stir-fry for 1–2 minutes until just turning pink. Remove and set aside (they will finish cooking later).

4. **Sauté Aromatics**  
   In the same pan, add garlic, ginger, and diced onion. Stir-fry for 1–2 minutes until fragrant and onions soften slightly.

5. **Simmer the Sauce**  
   Pour in the tomato sauce mixture and water. Stir to combine and simmer for 5 minutes.

6. **Thicken the Sauce**  
   Add the cornstarch slurry and cook another 1–2 minutes until the sauce thickens.

7. **Combine & Finish**  
   Return the shrimp to the pan. Stir to coat and simmer just until shrimp are fully cooked (about 1 more minute).

8. **Serve**  
   Garnish with chopped green onion. Serve hot with steamed rice.

## 📝 Notes
- You can substitute fresh tomatoes for canned but increase cooking time slightly to break them down.
- Adjust sugar and vinegar to taste depending on your tomato brand and sweetness preference.
