## 🧂 Tasso Spice Rub (Wet or Dry)

You can make this as a **wet rub (paste)** for overnight marination:

- 3 tbsp smoked paprika  
- 2 tbsp kosher salt  
- 2 tbsp brown sugar  
- 2 tsp cayenne pepper (or to taste)  
- 2 tsp garlic powder  
- 2 tsp onion powder

- 1½ tsp cracked black pepper  
- 1 tsp white pepper  
- 1 tsp ground allspice *(optional)*  
- 2 tbsp neutral oil  
- 1 tbsp Dijon or Creole mustard  
- Optional: 1 tsp liquid smoke (for gas grill use)

---

## 🥩 Pork Shoulder Prep

- 1 (4–5 lb) boneless pork shoulder  
- Trim excess fat, but leave a good layer on one side

**Marinate:**
- Rub paste all over pork shoulder
- Wrap tightly or vacuum seal  
- Refrigerate for **12–24 hours**

---

## 🔥 Smoking Instructions

1. Preheat smoker or grill for indirect cooking at **250–275°F**.  
2. Use **hickory or apple wood** for smoke (cherry also works).  
3. Place pork on the smoker fat-side up.  
4. Smoke for **4–5 hours**, or until it hits **165°F internal temp**.

## 🍎 Spiced Apple Cider Mop or Finishing Sauce

Optional but awesome:

- 1 cup apple cider  
- 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar  
- 1 tbsp maple syrup or brown sugar  
- ½ tsp smoked paprika  
- ½ tsp garlic powder  
- 1 tsp Dijon mustard  
- ¼ tsp cayenne or chili flakes  
- Pinch of salt

Simmer for 10–15 minutes until slightly reduced.  
Brush over pork every hour after the first 3 hours — or just warm and drizzle before serving.

## 🧈 Wrap & Finish

Once at **165°F**, wrap pork tightly in butcher paper or foil.  
Return to smoker and cook until it hits **195–203°F internal** — probe should slide in like butter.

Let rest **30–60 minutes** before shredding.
