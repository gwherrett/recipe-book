# Seared Duck Breast Salad

**Source:** Williams-Sonoma

This is a great salad to serve as a first course or a light entrée. You can vary the fruit depending on the season—try cherries in the spring or pomegranate seeds in the winter. Cheeses such as Parmigiano-Reggiano or a soft fresh goat cheese are also a nice addition.

**Servings:** 4

## Ingredients

### For the Duck:
- 2 boneless duck breast halves, each 4 to 6 oz
- Salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste

### For the Salad:
- 3 Tbs. sherry vinegar
- 7 Tbs. extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 head radicchio, washed and torn into 1-inch strips
- 2 heads frisée, washed and trimmed of thick green parts
- ½ cup walnuts, toasted and coarsely chopped
- 2 oranges, peeled and cut into segments

## Directions

1. **Prepare the duck:**
   Season the duck breast halves with salt and pepper. Using a sharp knife, score the skin by making a crisscross pattern, being careful not to cut into the meat.

2. **Sear the duck:**
   Heat a large sauté pan over medium-low heat. Place the duck, skin side down, in the pan and cook until the skin is very crisp and golden, 12 to 15 minutes. Turn the duck over and sear the other side, then continue cooking until the duck is just springy when pressed with a finger for rare to medium-rare, 3 to 5 minutes more, or until done to your liking. Let the duck rest for 3 to 5 minutes before carving.

3. **Make the vinaigrette:**
   Put the vinegar in a small bowl and add the olive oil in a slow, steady stream, whisking constantly until well blended. Season the vinaigrette with salt and pepper.

4. **Assemble the salad:**
   In a large bowl, toss together the radicchio and frisée. Pour half the vinaigrette over the greens and toss to combine. Divide the salad among 4 plates and scatter the walnuts and orange segments over the salads, dividing evenly.

5. **Slice and serve:**
   Slice the duck breasts and arrange over the salads. Drizzle with remaining vinaigrette if desired.

## Notes

- Scoring the duck skin helps render the fat and creates crispy skin
- Cook duck skin-side down first to render most of the fat - no need to add oil to pan
- Duck breast is best served medium-rare to medium for optimal tenderness
- Can substitute blood oranges when in season for a beautiful presentation
- Add crumbled goat cheese or shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano for richness
- Seasonal fruit variations: cherries (spring), figs (summer), pomegranate seeds (winter)
- Toast walnuts in dry pan or 350°F oven for 5-7 minutes for enhanced flavor
