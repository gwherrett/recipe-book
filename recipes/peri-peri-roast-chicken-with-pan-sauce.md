# Peri-Peri Roast Chicken with St-Hubert-Style Pan Sauce (KFC-Inspired Herb Blend)

**Category:** Mains → Roasts & Poultry  
**Summary:** A fusion of Portuguese peri-peri flavour with the comforting herb-spice depth of classic rotisserie chicken. The sauce uses roasted drippings, peri-peri marinade, and a St-Hubert-style gravy base lifted with thyme, sage, mustard, celery salt, and a blend of black and white pepper.

- 1 tbsp olive oil  
- Zest & juice of 1 lemon  
- 1 tsp salt  
- ½ tsp black pepper  
- ½ tsp white pepper  
- ½ tsp dried thyme  
- ¼ tsp dried sage (or finely chopped fresh)

### St-Hubert-Style Pan Sauce  
- ~½ cup reserved marinade (boiled to be safe)  
- 2–3 tbsp chicken drippings (from roasting pan; defatted)  
- 2 tbsp butter  
- 2 tbsp flour  
- 1½ cups chicken stock (or broth)  
- ½ tsp smoked paprika (optional, for deeper colour)  
- ½ tsp soy sauce or Worcestershire sauce  
- ½ tsp apple cider vinegar or lemon juice  
- Salt & pepper to taste  
- (Optional) 1 tsp honey or a pinch of sugar for balance

## Method  

1. **Marinate the Chicken**  
   Mix all marinade ingredients into a paste. Rub generously over chicken, ensuring coverage under the skin where possible. Refrigerate 2–12 hours.

2. **Roast the Chicken**  
   Preheat oven to 200 °C / 400 °F. Place chicken on a rack over a roasting pan to catch drippings. Roast 45–55 minutes, until juices run clear and internal temp reaches 74 °C / 165 °F. Remove chicken, tent with foil, and rest 10 minutes. Skim fat from pan drippings.

3. **Prepare the Sauce Base**  
   - Boil reserved marinade for 3–5 minutes to make it food-safe. Strain solids if desired.  
   - In a saucepan, melt butter and whisk in flour to form a light brown roux (~3 minutes).  
   - Gradually add chicken stock, whisking until smooth. Stir in drippings and boiled marinade.  
   - Add paprika, soy/Worcestershire, and vinegar/lemon juice. Simmer gently until thickened (~8–10 minutes).  

4. **Season & Finish**  
   Taste and adjust with salt, pepper, and a touch of honey if needed. The sauce should have savory depth, faint smokiness, and a mild tang — like St-Hubert BBQ sauce with a peri-peri echo.

5. **Serve**  
   Carve chicken and arrange on a platter. Serve sauce warm in a gravy boat. Optionally provide a separate hot peri-peri sauce for guests who want extra heat.

## Notes  
- The added **thyme, sage, mustard, celery salt, and white pepper** ground the bright peri-peri flavors with an aromatic, nostalgic richness.  
- **White pepper** is key — it gives that “restaurant rotisserie” note when combined with lemon and paprika.  
- For a creamier finish, whisk in a splash of milk or cream at the end for a velvety sauce.
