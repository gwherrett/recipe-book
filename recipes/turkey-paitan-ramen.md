# Turkey Paitan Ramen  
A milky, creamy **white paitan-style ramen broth** made using **turkey drumsticks** instead of chicken. Turkey produces a beautifully rich but clean broth when boiled vigorously to emulsify collagen and fat.  
This recipe includes the **Salt Flavouring Base (Shio Tare)** so the bowl is fully self-contained.

## Ingredients

## Ramen Bowl  
- 400ml Turkey Paitan Broth  
- 80–100g fresh egg ramen noodles  
- 2 tbsp Salt Flavouring Base (see below)

### Toppings

- 1 bunch bok choy, halved and blanched

- **1.2–1.5 kg turkey drumsticks** (skin ON)  
- Optional (boosts collagen):

## Instructions

## Make the Turkey Paitan Broth

### Pressure Cooker Method (Recommended)
1. Add turkey drumsticks (and optional wing/neck) to pressure cooker.  
2. Add water up to the max fill line and bring to a **strong boil**.  
3. Skim scum thoroughly.  
4. Stir and crush bones occasionally with a wooden spatula to encourage **cloudiness/emulsion**.  
5. Add onion, garlic, scallions, and ginger.  
6. Bring back to a boil, skim again, then **pressure cook 40 minutes**.  
7. Release pressure, strain through a sieve, keeping only the whitish broth.  
8. Add milk (optional) and bring to a brief boil.

### Stovetop Method (4.5–5 Hours)
1. Follow the same steps as above but:  
2. Boil **hard**, not a simmer, for **4.5–5 hours**, stirring every 10–15 minutes.  
3. Crush bones occasionally to emulsify collagen.  
4. Strain and finish with milk if desired.

**Target yield:** 800–1000ml.  
If yield is lower, add warm water to reach volume and bring to a brief boil.

- 1 tbsp mirin  
- 1 tsp sugar

### Instructions  
1. Combine all ingredients in a small saucepan.  
2. Heat gently until salt and sugar dissolve—**do not boil**.  
3. Cool completely and remove kombu.

# Assemble the Turkey Paitan Ramen

1. Add **2 tbsp Salt Flavouring Base** to the serving bowl.  
2. Cook ramen noodles according to package instructions; drain.  
3. Add **400ml hot Turkey Paitan Broth** to the bowl and stir to combine with tare.  
4. Taste and adjust salt if needed.  
5. Add noodles to bowl.  
6. Arrange toppings (turkey or chicken slices, bok choy, egg, scallions).  
7. Serve immediately.

## Notes

- Turkey bones require slightly more agitation to emulsify than chicken.  
- Milk creates a smoother white colour but is optional.  
- Broth keeps 2–3 days in fridge; freeze for longer storage.  
- Final consistency should be *milky, opaque, and lightly creamy*—not gelatinous or heavy.
