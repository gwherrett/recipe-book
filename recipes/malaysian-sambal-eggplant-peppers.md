- 1 red bell pepper, sliced

### Sambal Paste (blend together):

- 2 fresh red chilies (or 1 red chili + 1 tomato for less heat)
- 3 shallots
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1 tsp toasted belacan (or 1/2 tsp shrimp paste)
- 1 tsp tamarind paste (or juice from 1 lime)

- Salt to taste

### Optional:

- Fresh lime or calamansi for serving

## Instructions

1. **Prepare Eggplant**: Salt and drain the cubed eggplant for 20 mins to reduce bitterness. Rinse and pat dry.

2. **Fry the Eggplant**: Heat 2–3 tbsp oil in a wok or skillet. Fry eggplant until soft and golden. Remove and set aside.

3. **Fry the Sambal Paste**:
   - Add 1–2 tbsp oil to the same pan.
   - Sauté the blended sambal paste over medium heat until the oil separates and it turns darker red (5–8 mins). This step is key—don’t rush it.

4. **Combine**:
   - Add sliced bell pepper and green chili to the sambal, cook 2 mins.
   - Return the eggplant to the pan and toss gently to coat everything in the sambal.

5. **Adjust & Finish**:
   - Taste and balance with more sugar, salt, or lime juice if needed.
   - Simmer everything together for another 2–3 mins for flavors to meld.

6. **Serve**:
   - Best served with jasmine rice and maybe a fried egg or some crispy anchovies on the side.

## Notes
- This recipe captures the essence of Malaysian sambal, with its smoky, umami base from belacan.
- For a vegetarian version, omit belacan and anchovy powder.
