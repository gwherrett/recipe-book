# Lobster Pasta Sauce (Busara-Style)
*Adapted from Marcella Hazan — “Marcella Cucina” (1997)*

## Summary
A classic coastal pasta sauce from Grado in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, traditionally made with Adriatic scampi. Marcella Hazan adapts the recipe using lobster, producing a quick, aromatic, deeply flavorful sauce built on onion, garlic, parsley, wine, and tomatoes. Best served with spaghettini.

## Ingredients
- **2 live lobsters**, about 1¼ lb each  
- **⅓ cup extra-virgin olive oil**, plus more for finishing  
- **2 cups onion**, finely chopped  
- **3 tbsp garlic**, finely chopped  
- **⅓ cup flat-leaf parsley**, finely chopped  
- **½ cup dry white wine**  
- **2 cups canned Italian plum tomatoes**, cut up with their juices  
  - *or fresh peeled tomatoes, diced*  
- **¼ tsp chili pepper** (fresh or dried), or to taste  
- **Salt**, to taste  
- **1 lb spaghettini**

## Instructions

### 1. Prepare the Lobster
1. Separate the head from the tail.  
2. Split the underside of the tail shell and cut the tail into 3 pieces.  
3. Remove claws, crack them, and check for loose shell.  
4. Split the head lengthwise; leave tomalley and roe.

### 2. Make the Base Sauce
1. Heat **⅓ cup olive oil** in a large sauté pan over medium.  
2. Add onion and a pinch of salt; cook until pale gold.  
3. Add garlic and cook a few seconds until fragrant.  
3. Add parsley, stir.  
4. Add wine; simmer 1–2 minutes until alcohol aroma fades.  
5. Add tomatoes, chili, and salt; simmer **15–20 minutes**, until oil separates.

### 3. Cook the Pasta
Boil in salted water and drain **very al dente** — pasta will finish in the sauce.

### 4. Cook the Lobster in the Sauce
1. Add lobster pieces with a pinch of salt.  
2. Turn for **2–3 minutes**.  
3. If lobster releases liquid, remove it, boil liquid off, then return lobster.  
4. Cook **2 more minutes**, turning pieces.

### 5. Finish & Serve
1. Transfer pasta to a warm bowl.  
2. Pour sauce + lobster over top.  
3. Toss thoroughly.  
4. Drizzle with **raw olive oil**, toss again, serve hot.

## Make-Ahead
Prepare up to the point where lobster is removed and excess liquid boiled away. Hold up to 1 hour. Reheat sauce, return lobster, finish dish.
