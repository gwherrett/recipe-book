# Caesar Dressing with Anchovy

**Slug:** caesar-dressing-with-anchovy  
**Category:** Condiments & Sauces  
**Summary:** A classic, savory Caesar dressing built on garlic, anchovy, lemon, Dijon, Worcestershire, and Parmesan. Creamy, punchy, and ready in minutes.

## Ingredients
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 6 anchovy fillets, very finely chopped (or 2 tsp anchovy paste)
- 1 tsp Dijon mustard
- 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce
- 2 tbsp fresh lemon juice (about 1/2 lemon)
- 1/2 cup mayonnaise
- 1/4 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- Pinch of salt (optional; anchovies and Parmesan are salty)
- 1–2 tbsp water or milk, as needed to thin

## Method
1. In a small bowl, mash together the garlic and anchovies to form a paste. Stir in the Dijon and Worcestershire.
2. Whisk in the lemon juice.
3. In a separate bowl, combine the mayonnaise and Parmesan until smooth.
4. Whisk the anchovy mixture into the mayo-Parmesan until fully emulsified.
5. Season with black pepper and a small pinch of salt if needed.
6. Adjust consistency with water or milk, 1 tsp at a time, until pourable.
7. Refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 1 week.

## Notes
- For a lighter version, swap half the mayo for plain Greek yogurt.
- Classic tableside style: replace mayo with 1 raw egg yolk and 1/4 cup neutral oil; drizzle the oil in slowly while whisking to emulsify.
- Add 1/2 tsp fish sauce to boost umami if anchovies are mild.
