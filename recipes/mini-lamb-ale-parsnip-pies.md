# Mini Lamb, Ale & Parsnip Pies (Muffin‑Tin)

**Category:** Mains / Pies & Pastries  
**Tags:** lamb, ale, parsnip, carrot, potato, muffin‑tin, freezer‑friendly  
**Yield:** ~18 mini pies (1.5× batch)

## Summary
Portable, pub‑style lamb & ale pies scaled for a muffin tin. A thick, stew‑like filling of lamb, dark ale, rich lamb broth, carrots, potatoes, and parsnips is enclosed in a buttery shortcrust with a puff‑pastry lid. Ideal for batch cooking and freezing.

## Ingredients

### Filling
- 2.25 lb (1 kg) lamb chuck or mince (or a mix)
- 1 ½ Tbsp oil or lamb fat
- 1 ½ large onions, finely diced (or 2 medium)
- 3 medium carrots, finely diced (~1 ½ cups / 200 g)
- 1 ½ medium potatoes, finely diced (~1 ½ cups / 225 g)
- 1 ½ medium parsnips, finely diced (~1 ½ cups / 200 g)
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 ½ Tbsp tomato paste
- 3 Tbsp flour
- 1 ½ cups (360 ml) dark ale (porter, stout, or brown ale)
- 2 ¼ cups (525 ml) rich lamb broth
- 1 ½ tsp Worcestershire sauce (optional)
- 1 ½ bay leaves (or 2 small)
- 1 ½ sprigs thyme
- Pinch rosemary (or a few chopped leaves)
- Salt & freshly ground black pepper

### Pastry
- ~750 g shortcrust pastry (for bases)
- ~375 g puff pastry (for lids)
- 1–2 eggs, beaten (for egg wash)

## Method

### 1) Make the Filling
1. Heat oil or lamb fat in a heavy pot. Season lamb with salt and pepper, brown in batches, and set aside.
2. Add onion, carrot, potato, and parsnip. Cook 8–10 minutes until starting to soften and lightly caramelize.
3. Stir in garlic and tomato paste; cook 2 minutes.
4. Sprinkle flour over the vegetables; cook 1 minute to remove raw taste.
5. Deglaze with ale, scraping up any browned bits. Simmer 3–4 minutes to reduce alcohol.
6. Return lamb to the pot. Add broth, Worcestershire (if using), bay, thyme, and rosemary. Bring to a gentle simmer.
7. Simmer ~1–1.5 hours with the lid on until lamb is tender and the sauce is thick. If too thin, uncover and reduce until stew‑like and spoonable. Taste and adjust seasoning. 
8. Cool the filling completely before assembling pies (critical for crisp pastry).

### 2) Assemble the Mini Pies
1. Heat oven to 400°F / 200°C. Grease an 18‑cup muffin tray (or two 12‑cup trays).
2. Roll shortcrust to ~⅛" / 3 mm. Cut 4.5–5" (11–13 cm) circles and press into cups.
3. Spoon in cooled filling, nearly to the top.
4. Roll puff pastry and cut ~3" (8 cm) circles. Cap each pie and crimp to seal with the bottom crust.
5. Cut a small steam vent in each. Brush tops with beaten egg.

### 3) Bake
- Bake 25–30 minutes, until deeply golden and the filling bubbles at the edges. 
- Cool in the tin for 10 minutes, then gently loosen and lift out with a butter knife.

## Freezer Notes
- **Freeze unbaked (best texture):** Assemble in the muffin tin, freeze until solid, pop out and wrap individually (cling film + foil). Bake from frozen at 375°F / 190°C for 35–40 minutes (egg‑wash just before baking if not already glazed).
- **Freeze baked:** Cool completely, wrap well. Reheat at 350°F / 175°C for 20–25 minutes.

## Serving
Great with minted peas, a sharp green salad, or a spoon of chutney. Enjoy with the same ale used in the filling.
