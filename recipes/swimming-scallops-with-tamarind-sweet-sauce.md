# Swimming Scallops with Tamarind Sweet Sauce (Inspired by the Lunch Lady)

This recipe combines fresh scallops with a tangy, sweet tamarind sauce that packs a punch, inspired by the vibrant flavors of Southeast Asian street food.

## Ingredients

### For the Scallops:
- 1 lb (500g) fresh scallops, cleaned
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil
- 2 cloves garlic, finely minced
- 1 small shallot, finely minced
- 1 tsp fish sauce
- A pinch of salt and white pepper

### For the Tamarind Sweet Sauce:
- 3 tbsp tamarind paste
- 2 tbsp palm sugar (or brown sugar)
- 1 tbsp fish sauce
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 red chili, thinly sliced (optional for heat)
- 1 tsp lime juice
- 1 tbsp water (to adjust consistency)
- 1 tsp toasted sesame seeds (for garnish)

### Optional Accompaniments:
- Steamed jasmine rice
- Fresh cilantro leaves
- Sliced cucumber or pickled vegetables

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Sauce:**  
   In a small bowl, mix tamarind paste, palm sugar, fish sauce, soy sauce, lime juice, and water. Stir until the sugar dissolves and the mixture is smooth. Adjust sweetness or tanginess to your preference.

2. **Sear the Scallops:**  
   Heat a skillet over medium-high heat and add the vegetable oil.  
   Pat the scallops dry and season lightly with salt and white pepper.  
   Place the scallops in the pan, searing for 1–2 minutes on each side until golden brown. Remove from the pan and set aside.

3. **Cook the Aromatics:**  
   In the same skillet, reduce heat to medium and add minced garlic and shallots. Sauté until fragrant (about 1 minute).

4. **Combine with Sauce:**  
   Pour the tamarind sauce mixture into the skillet with the aromatics. Bring to a gentle simmer, stirring to combine. Cook for 2–3 minutes until the sauce thickens slightly.

5. **Add the Scallops:**  
   Return the scallops to the skillet, tossing gently to coat them in the sauce. Let them cook for another minute to absorb the flavors. Do not overcook to avoid rubbery scallops.

6. **Serve:**  
   Arrange the scallops on a plate, drizzle with extra sauce, and sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds.  
   Garnish with fresh cilantro leaves and serve with steamed jasmine rice or your choice of accompaniments.

Enjoy this dish warm, savoring the perfect balance of tangy tamarind, sweet palm sugar, and savory fish sauce!
