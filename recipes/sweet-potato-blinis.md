# Sweet Potato Blinis

Sweet potato blinis from The Deerholme Vegetable Cookbook (via Fresh Roots). Golden and crispy on the outside, tender inside, with a subtle warmth from paprika. Serve topped with chives, sour cream, and tomatillo jam.

## Ingredients

- 2 cups cooked sweet potato
- 2 eggs
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp paprika
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 cup milk or milk alternative
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil, plus more for the pan

### To Serve
- Chives, chopped
- Sour cream (or dairy-free alternative)
- Tomatillo jam

## Instructions

1. **Mash the sweet potato.**
   Peel and mash the cooked sweet potatoes until smooth.

2. **Add eggs.**
   Add the eggs and stir to combine.

3. **Add dry ingredients.**
   Sprinkle in the flour, baking powder, paprika, and salt. Stir gently to combine.

4. **Add milk.**
   Pour in the milk and stir until the mixture comes together into a smooth batter.

5. **Pan-fry.**
   Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add a light coating of oil. Spoon about 2 tbsp of batter per blini into the pan, leaving about 1 inch between each one.

6. **Cook until golden.**
   Fry until golden brown and crispy on the outside, about 2 minutes per side. If the blinis start to scorch, reduce heat to medium-low.

7. **Serve.**
   Top with chives, sour cream, and tomatillo jam.
