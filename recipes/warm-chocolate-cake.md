# Warm Chocolate Cake

**Source:** Lucy Waverman, Autumn 2003

A wonderful dessert that has a rich, solid exterior and an oozing saucy interior. Also known as molten chocolate cake or chocolate lava cake. Terrific served with whipped cream. The mixture can be made ahead and refrigerated until 30 minutes before baking to allow them to come back to room temperature. Make sure the muffin tins are well greased for easy removal of the cakes.

**Servings:** 6

## Instructions

1. **Preheat oven:**
   Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).

2. **Melt chocolate and butter:**
   In heavy pot on low heat, melt chocolate and butter together. Cool slightly.

3. **Beat egg yolks:**
   Beat together sugar and egg yolks with an electric mixer until thick and creamy, about 4 minutes.

4. **Combine chocolate mixture:**
   Pour in chocolate mixture and beat together for 5 minutes.

5. **Fold in egg whites:**
   In a separate bowl, beat egg whites until stiff peaks form, about 3 minutes. Fold into mixture along with flour.

6. **Bake:**
   Pour into 6 non-stick buttered moulds or non-stick muffin tins. Bake for 5 to 7 minutes or until edges are just cooked and centre is still liquid.

7. **Serve:**
   Cool for 5 minutes in tins. Carefully remove to serving dishes. Serve immediately with lightly whipped cream.
