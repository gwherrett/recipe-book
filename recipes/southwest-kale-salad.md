**Category:** Salads & Bowls  
**Tags:** Vegetarian, Meal Prep, Kale, Southwest  
**Serves:** 4 as a side, 2–3 as a main  
**Time:** 20 minutes

## Summary
A hearty kale-based salad loaded with black beans, corn, peppers, tomatoes, and avocado, tossed in a zesty lime–cumin dressing and finished with crunchy tortilla strips. Great for meal prep—just add the avocado and chips at serving time.

## Ingredients
### Salad
- 1 large bunch (about 250–300 g) curly kale, stems removed, torn or thinly sliced
- 1 Tbsp olive oil (for massaging kale)
- Pinch of salt
- 1 can (398 ml / 14 oz) black beans, rinsed and drained
- 1 cup (160 g) corn kernels (fresh, frozen and thawed, or canned and drained)
- 1 red bell pepper, diced
- 1/2 small red onion, finely diced
- 1 cup (150 g) cherry tomatoes, halved
- 1/4 cup (10 g) fresh cilantro, chopped
- 1 ripe avocado, sliced or diced (add at serving)
- 1 cup tortilla strips or crushed tortilla chips (add at serving)

### Dressing
- 1/4 cup (60 ml) olive oil
- 2 Tbsp fresh lime juice (from ~1 lime)
- 1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar
- 1–2 tsp honey or agave, to taste
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1/2 tsp chili powder (optional, for heat)
- 1/4 tsp garlic powder (optional)
- 1/4 tsp kosher salt, plus more to taste
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste

## Method
1. **Prep the kale.** Add kale to a large bowl with 1 Tbsp olive oil and a pinch of salt. Massage for 30–60 seconds until darker and slightly tender.
2. **Combine the salad.** Add black beans, corn, bell pepper, red onion, cherry tomatoes, and cilantro to the bowl.
3. **Make the dressing.** In a small jar or bowl, whisk together olive oil, lime juice, vinegar, honey/agave, cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.
4. **Toss.** Pour dressing over the salad and toss to coat. Taste and adjust salt, lime, or sweetness.
5. **Finish and serve.** Top with avocado and tortilla strips just before serving so they stay fresh and crisp.

## Tips & Variations
- **Protein boost:** Add grilled chicken, shrimp, or baked tofu.  
- **Cheese:** Crumble in queso fresco, cotija, or feta.  
- **Make-ahead:** Dress the kale/veg up to 2 days in advance; add avocado and chips at serving.  
- **Roasted corn option:** Char corn in a dry skillet for extra flavor.  
- **Spice it up:** Add sliced jalapeño or a dash of hot sauce.
