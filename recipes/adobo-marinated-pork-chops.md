# Adobo-Marinated Pork Chops

A delicious pork chop recipe marinated in classic Filipino adobo flavors—savory, tangy, and slightly sweet.

## Ingredients

- 4 bone-in or boneless pork chops  
- ½ cup soy sauce  
- ¼ cup vinegar (white or apple cider)  
- 1 tablespoon lemon or calamansi juice (optional)  
- 4 cloves garlic, minced  
- 1 teaspoon black peppercorns, crushed  
- 2 bay leaves  
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar (optional)  
- ½ teaspoon paprika (optional, for a smoky touch)  
- 1 teaspoon onion powder  
- 1 teaspoon salt  
- ½ teaspoon black pepper  
- 1 tablespoon oil (for searing)  
- ½ cup water (for simmering)

## Instructions

### Marinating the Pork Chops
1. In a bowl, combine soy sauce, vinegar, lemon juice, minced garlic, crushed black peppercorns, bay leaves, brown sugar, paprika, onion powder, salt, and black pepper.  
2. Place the pork chops in a resealable plastic bag or shallow dish and pour the marinade over them.  
3. Massage the marinade into the meat and let it sit in the refrigerator for **at least 2 hours**, preferably overnight for deeper flavor.

### Cooking the Pork Chops
1. Remove the pork chops from the marinade and **pat them dry** with a paper towel to ensure a good sear.  
2. Heat oil in a skillet over **medium-high heat**.  
3. Sear the pork chops for about **3–4 minutes per side** until golden brown.  
4. Pour in the **remaining marinade** and add **½ cup of water**.  
5. Lower the heat and let it simmer for about **10–15 minutes**, flipping the chops occasionally, until the sauce reduces and thickens slightly.  
6. Once the pork chops are fully cooked (internal temperature should be **145°F / 63°C**), remove from heat and let them rest for a few minutes.

## Serving Suggestions

- Serve over steamed rice with a drizzle of the adobo sauce.  
- Pair with sautéed vegetables or a fresh salad.  
- Garnish with sliced green onions or fried garlic for extra flavor.
