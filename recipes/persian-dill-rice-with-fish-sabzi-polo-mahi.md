## Ingredients

### Rice
- 2 cups (380–400 g) basmati rice, rinsed until water runs clear
- 1½ tbsp kosher salt, for boiling water (plus to taste)
- 1 packed cup fresh dill, finely chopped (about 30 g)
- ½ cup mixed herbs, finely chopped — **optional** (parsley, cilantro, chives or green onion tops)
- 2 tbsp neutral oil **and** 2 tbsp butter (or 4 tbsp ghee)
- ½ tsp ground saffron threads bloomed in 2 tbsp hot water — **optional**
- ¼ cup water for steaming

### Fish
- 4 fillets (600–700 g total) salmon, trout, cod, halibut, or whitefish
- 1 lemon, juiced (about 2–3 tbsp)
- 2 cloves garlic, grated
- ¾ tsp kosher salt
- ½ tsp black pepper
- ½ tsp ground cumin **or** coriander (optional, non‑traditional)
- 2–3 tbsp flour **or** rice flour, for light dredge (optional, helps crisp)
- 2–3 tbsp neutral oil + 1 tbsp butter (for pan‑searing)

### Optional Tahdig Base

## Method

### 1) Par‑boil the rice
1. Rinse rice well; soak 20–30 minutes in plenty of cold water with 1 tsp salt. Drain.
2. Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil; salt it (like pasta water).
3. Add soaked rice; boil 6–8 minutes until grains are mostly tender but still firm at the core (*al dente*).  
4. Stir in chopped dill (and optional herbs) for the last 60–90 seconds. Drain in a sieve and briefly rinse to stop cooking.

### 2) Build the pot (with optional **tahdig**)
5. In the same pot, heat 2 tbsp oil + 2 tbsp butter over medium.  
6. (Optional **tahdig**): line base with potato slices **or** lavash **or** spread yogurt‑oil mixture.
7. Gently mound the rice back into the pot in a loose cone to promote steam flow. Poke 4–5 steam holes with a chopstick. Drizzle ¼ cup water around edges. If using saffron, pour the bloomed saffron over the top for streaks of color.
8. Wrap the lid with a clean tea towel, cover, and cook on **low** 30–40 minutes (diffuser helpful).

### 3) Cook the fish
9. Pat fish dry. Toss with lemon juice, garlic, salt, pepper (and optional spice). Rest 10 minutes. Pat dry again; lightly dredge in flour if using.
10. Heat oil in a nonstick or well‑seasoned pan over medium‑high. Add fish; reduce to medium. Sear 2–4 minutes per side (thickness‑dependent) until just cooked and golden; add a knob of butter in the last minute and baste. Rest 2 minutes.

### 4) Serve
11. Loosen rice. For tahdig, invert the pot or slide out the crust and break into shards. Fluff remaining rice.  
12. Plate herbed rice with fish alongside. Spoon any saffron butter from the pot over rice. Serve with lemon wedges.

## Notes & Tips
- **Rice texture:** Persian rice should be fluffy and separated, not sticky. The par‑boil + steam method is key.  
- **Herb mix:** Dill is the star; parsley/cilantro/chives add complexity. Dried dill can substitute: use 2–3 tbsp, bloom briefly in hot water.  
- **Saffron:** Bloom ground saffron in hot (not boiling) water for best color/aroma.  
- **Make‑ahead:** Par‑boil rice and chop herbs up to 6 hours ahead; steam just before serving.  
- **Air‑fryer fish:** 200 °C / 400 °F for 7–10 minutes (brush with oil; do not overcook).  
- **Serving ideas:** Add crunchy pickled cucumbers or Shirazi salad; yogurt with cucumber; or lime‑forward torshi.
