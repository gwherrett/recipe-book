## Notes

- The key is poking holes in the hot loaf so the glaze soaks in
- Can use lemon zest instead of "rind of lemon" - they're the same thing
- Best served the next day after flavors have melded
- Store wrapped in plastic wrap or in airtight container
- Can substitute lemon extract (1 tsp) if fresh lemon unavailable, but fresh is much better
- Makes a great gift loaf
