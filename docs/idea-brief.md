# Idea Brief

## 1. What are you building and why?

### What are you building?
An online recipe "cleaner " and repository that is supported by an ecommerce site for sauces for your sauces!

### What need or challenge is this addressing?
COVID made it easier than ever for people to order food in. This is costly and typically not as healthy as cooking at home.

Unfortunately the current recipe site ecosystem is not helping consumers become meal producers! 20 years ago, you could go to a web site and print out a fairly clean recipe. Now they have been enshittifed  with SEO (increasingly AI slop) and intrusive pop-up videos.

This seemed to come to a head this American Thanksgiving, as Google AI Overviews  and AI slop took over: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-25/ai-slop-recipes-are-taking-over-the-internet-and-thanksgiving-dinner
 

### How does it provide value?
This site will allow users to save recipes in a clean template that makes it easy to follow.

As an added bogus, it will evaluate the recipes for their health benefits

Finally, it will provide sauces that can be purchased to accelerate your cooking in cuisines were you may be unfamiliar or not have some of the ingredients or spices

### What research validates this need?
Sauce based cookbooks:
